"vulnerable India ""dr mayengbam lalit singh recently honourable pm of india launched scheme called """" doubling farmers ' income """" in order to uplift the welfare being of larger portion of indians . the big questions felt by people are ( i ) how would it be possible in short period of time ? and ( ii ) is it an elusive doctrine to sweep vote bank of millions of farmers for upcoming parliamentary election in 2019 ? across all over india ( except for a few states ) so many rigidities have to be solved in order to raise the real income of farmers . these rigidities are characterised by infrastructures , structures and institutions . the present article focuses on those rigidities only for manipur which has been lagging behind many indian states . regarding infrastructure ( inputs ) , the state is found backward among those backward states of india . introspecting water infrastructure , the state has been under-utilising water resources despite the abundant availability . for kharif season crops farmers rely on rain water since the state is under the map of se monsoon . however , during rabi and zayed seasons the state has been witnessing scarcity of water . in order to curb this shortage , government needs construction of multiple check dams and digging bore wells in those small streams flowing across the plain areas . during peak season , there is always a shortage of manures and pesticides due to landslide on national highways . revolution of organic farming will lessen dependency on chemical fertilisers since the state has high potential of producing organic manures and pesticides . during post harvesting period , the state needs to construct cold storages so that perishable crops can be stored for agricultural off seasons . regarding financial support to farming , banks are not integrated with farmers . moreover state government does not organise crop insurance schemes in order to compensate the loss due to natural calamity . my previous article on """" channelizing mahatma gandhi national rural employment guarantee act ( mgnrega ) with crop and livestock insurances in india """" postulates the model on how to compensate the loss . the second rigid character of farming is that there had been no structural change over decades . farming in manipur focuses on production of only coarse cereals which is characterised by immediate consumption . in this era of globalisation farming should have close introspection of demand and supply model of consumers across the world . especially in hilly areas , cultivation of coarse cereal is just to meet local consumption and not for earning profits . nowadays , farmers stated cultivation of illegal crops such as poppy illegally in order to earn huge profit . in order to prevent this , government should emphasise on cultivation cash crops such yongchak ( parkia speciosa ) , cardamom , tea , coffee , black pepper , etc. since these crops are highly demanded in international as well as domestic market . on the other hand this can reduce environmental destruction which is followed after short period zoom cultivation . in plain areas also main crops are also coarse cereals which are vulnerable to low profit . farmers should diversify in cultivation of cash crops such as black rice , medicinal plants , oil seeds , mushrooms , etc . moreover farmers should engage themselves in nonfarm sectors wherein both farm and nonfarm sectors can be fitted in supply and demand schedule for their inputs and outputs . one of the institutional rigidities faced by the farmers is asymmetric information on the technological development in agricultural sector . krishi vigyan kendras ( kvks ) had been instituted in every districts across india in order to fill the information gap between farmers and agricultural scientists . however their works had been found confined to laboratories only and their expertises are hardly in the knowledge domain of farmers . government should frame policies for kvks so that they should be available to farmers at least once in a week on alternative blocks . another institutional rigidity we witness is financial inaccessibility of farmers to existing financial institutions ( banks ) . in india , banks are found to release funds to manufacturing and service sectors but not on agricultural sector . too much official procedures and rigid financial securities create inaccessibility of farmers to banks . so the banks should be advised to make survey on the constructive environment wherein farmers should accede and return loans in time . another important institutional rigidity is lack of marketing institutions such as marketing farms and agents which can deal in such agricultural products . government should invite both local and nonlocal farms which can link farmers with consumers at price determined by market rate . government also should have policies such as minimum support price and construction of cold storages so that various types of agricultural products can be available during their offseason . the last most important institutional rigidities is inability of government to constitute an integral body which comprises above mentioned farmers body , financial institutes , kvks , marketing farms and government funded research institutes . if the integral body function with mutual exchange of workings with all institutional constituents , dream of """" doubling farmers ' income """" can be achieved . let this article may draw attention of agricultural ministry in fulfilling its ambition .""",0
