What convinced me was the flood gates that must logically be opened by its permission. First we allow married couples to use contraception. This tells us that openness to life is not an intrinsic part of marriage. If that is true then contrary to the very clear theology of creation, covenant, and sacrament, gay marriage is possible, and further the Church must admit that it is. Strike 1. There is a contraceptive advert ""sin twice: use a condom"". This works because the Church says a condom is never licit. By allowing it in licit sex, you'd be hard pressed to convert anyone that it is explicitly not allowed in illicit sex. If the easiest practical solution is allowed when following the law, practicality must be allowed when not following the law. There is now no practical barrier (I don't want extramarital children therefore I won't) to fornication. Strike 2. Now to the killer. Contraception is not 100% effective. The number of extramarital unwanted pregnancies where the mother feels she has a moral right to not be pregnant because ""I did everything right"" soars. Abortions go up. Strikes 3 - infinity.",1

So, while they're busy putting in work (mental effort/ mental accounting for energy expenditure not being an accurate representation of actual energy expended or actual work contributed towards desired results), they're going to get nothing out of it. They're not going to get the results they want and eventually they're going to quit. So, no, it really is much worse than doing nothing at all. This gives the illusion of effectiveness.

This isn't a case of a robot cooking all the food.

Whether or not it has the ascribed status of a theory or a matter of faith, it still represents a matter of some faith if you express belief in it.

What is the ""dogma"" of atheists? Is it documented somwhere? Is there some definitive guide? There are shades of centrality in atheism, much of it centered around the writings of Darwin, Sagan, and Dawkins. Dawkins is probably the closest thing popular atheist culture has to a pope. His writings are squarely evangelical. >You have yet to establish the ""religion"" of atheists. In most cases, they probably subscribe to a dogmatically materialist view of reality-- that all things that are real must be personally apparent and manifest physically. Although modern scientific culture (real science has no certainty) lauds this belief as the most plausible, it's still quite dogmatic and requires a degree of faith in the secular foundations of academia. >So far it has something to do with evangelizing even though it should be clear by now that evangelizism is not a primary component of religion nor is it even a good indicator. I can name a dozen things off hand that people evangelize, but wouldn't even come close to being religious in nature. If people are ""evangelizing"" something, then they are employed in a religious behavior, even if they're talking about something consumer-oriented-- like Apple products. If they're evangelizing a higher truth or reality that is outside human understanding (like whether or not there is a higher power), then it's distinctly religious evangelism. If atheism was merely a function of doubt, then there would be no evangelism. It wouldn't even operate as a group or subculture. >Maybe it would. So what? If they don't believe in deities or spirits and don't perform rituals in an organized manner, I have no problem excluding them as religions. We have other classifications.

Are you sure this has as much to do with definition as it does with the way your subculture has characterized religion? >You can view it however you want. I just don't think you're going to draw many meaningful arguments coming from that position. Why don't we just call every philosophy a religion? Why stop at materialism? Why not call economic conservatism a religion? Why not call pro-choice a religion? Where does it stop? Materialism is a comprehensive and emotionally driven philosophy that defines post 19th century culture. It's too large, disruptive, and regimented to be seen as a simple idea.

"Why don't you look at the evidence in the 2004 trial? Why don't you hear the accounts of the various people who worked in neverland? You would do yourself a great service if you did. Honestly, read some of their accounts - not just MJs. Read what happened in the Chandler case. He was sleeping in his bed all the time! ""Well he never made these claims til after MJ died, so excuse me for not rushing to believe him. He was part of the Johnny Young Talent Group, which is like our equivalent of Broadway for kids, I guess, so it wouldn't be unusual for them to hold dance contests."" This is an attempt to discredit Wade because he waited a long time to report it. This is a common thing to do. The reality is, people who haven't been abused or groomed have a real trouble to understand the behavior of victims. It's common for people in Wade's alleged situation to perceive their abuse, not as abuse, but as normal. These children weren't forced into sexual situations but were coerced and they volitionally performed sexual acts. In that way, there is the element of abuse victims not seeing themselves as victims. Often, a big life moment that occurs in the victim makes them re-evaluate their past, in this case it was Wade's baby boy that was born. He had a nervous breakdown as a result. Again, I can't stress this enough. We shouldn't believe Wade 100% yet, but don't dismiss him because his behaviour doesn't match with what you consider to be a reasonable person - if he has been abused then his behaviour is prone to be different. (Also note that not only Wade is in litigation, also Jimmy Safechuck is) ""It's not feasible at all! Michael is an entertainer, of course he'd be looking for the next big talent or dancers to be in his videos. Is anyone side eyeing Missy Elliott for hiring countless children to dance in her videos? Beyonce signed two teens to her label, is her behaviour creepy or suspicious? It's nothing new and certainly nothing suspicious for industry power figures to go hunting for young talent. You'd be accusing 99% of the entertainment industry of pedophilia. Showbiz careers take years to form, then even more time to establish an audience/fanbase. Most stars sign young so by the time they're well known, they're still only 21 or so."" Okay, point taken, but Wade slept in MJ's bed - Beyonce isn't sleeping with her potential stars. Also, Jordi Chandler and Jimmy Safechuck were not performers - amongst others. ""If that man is only sharing his room and/or bed with close family friends whose parents are fully aware of the situation and have given permission - which is all that was happening - then no, I would not suspect anything unless given a reason to. Michael even said himself he would NOT let his own kids sleep in a strange man's bed, only family friends. He said the only reason kids were in his bed is because they were too scared to sleep alone in other parts of the mansion and because they asked to sleep in the bed rather than on the floor: Source: He explains here that he was sleeping on the floor in a sleeping bag, then reiterates that he shared a bed with Macaulay Culkin and his siblings, aka close family friends (Culkin attended Michael's funeral and testified at his trial)."" Again, this is a common issue. Your only source of information, or your main source, is the potential culprit himself...MJ! Of course he's going to say he didn't sleep with these boys. You might aswell not mention that. MJ played the image game - he didn't always tell the truth. Consider his excuses for his plastic surgeries, him claiming he didn't bleach his skin, him claiming he's not anti-Semitic yet he did hold those beliefs (there's a reason he wrote ""jew me)"". He clearly had more than 2 surgeries and it wasn't due to breaking your nose - you don't need to make your nose smaller when you break your nose! It's actually laughable that one flies by. The point is, MJ isn't the beacon of truth - he knew that he had to say the right things. (By the way, don't get side tracked by that, you may well think actually MJ was telling the truth about all of the above but I'm not interested to debate that)",1
"We make lots of sacrifices for our marriages. The sense of enjoyment you get out of debating religion could be one of them.

But note that I am trying my best to tackle the argument, not the person behind the argument. >Lore and world building is extremely rare on western cartoons, i can only think of avatar, to be honest. So what if it's rare? It didn't stop Avatar from doing it, did it? Furthermore Avatar is an entirely different animal altogether, one that concerns both western and eastern animation. A topic I'd rather not get into at the moment. >A show like that needs to know exactly what it wants to be, because every little thing comes to play later on I don't know what to tell you, this.... is simply untrue. A story can have complicated and fascinating world building without planning out everything from the beginning. Rick and Morty for example is a good example of this. I HIGHLY doubt that Harmon and Roiland had every piece of plot points and world building mapped out from the very beginning. And yet the show still manages to explore many fascinating worlds many of which has their own sets of culture and laws. Just because a story started out simple, doesn't mean it can't build an interesting world later on. >Star Vs. doesn't do that, you can well tell by how they introduced the concept of Star's wand using batteries, yet never brought it up again. And yet 2 seasons in we are now exploring the magic realm within the wand and even the the magic realm where the source of magic come from. Star vs is obviously a show that is susceptible to change. It may have started out episodic with little to no direction, but now we have dimensions to explore, kingdoms with its own culture and social difference between races on Mewni. Clearly the writers want to build a world here. If not they wouldn't have spent time meticulously mapping out the world of Mewni and coming up with creatures like centaurs, mermaids, etc. All of which can be found in the Mastering all Dimension book. >but given that they spent the better part of two seasons on earth, the chances of them truly building up on that are freaking small. Yeah, and the fact that the majority of the season 3 intro take place on Mewni means nothing eh? >it is simply not their time to shine or to introduce them to the great scope of things. Fine, then. If that's the case then please do tell me what the purpose of episodes like Pizza Thing was? Pony Head's character arc has already been resolved in St. Olga's. What possible purpose could an episode about dicking around in skinny jeans have? And if the answer is that the episode serves as a slice of life filler then I'm afraid I've got some bad news for you. Like I said in my post, ""need is a strong word, we need doorstops but a brick would suffice."" We don't need the episode Pizza Thing, because we already have plenty of other slice of life filler that would serve the same purpose if not do a better job. >It's the same with Jackie. Chances are whatever plot line they are planning on following with her is going to involve Star's relationship with Marco, and they couldn't begin to explore that before Star confessed, and that needed time to happen as well. Right, because having no development is better than having SOME development. Is that what you're saying? Gotcha. >Dude, your stance on Pony head is extremely opinionated. That is fine, everyone has preferences. But maybe don't try to support that dislike with more opinions disguised as objective facts. I find this painfully ironic. As these are the things you keep on saying in your comment: >i feel the exact opposite of that... I very much prefer... i actually find... i hate him. I have rarely in my post ever refer to my own personal feeling.

"If fuel cannot propel itself off the ground, it is not fuel. You are talking about a universe in which there is no combustible substance that has more potential energy, releasable through a chemical process, than its own resting potential energy. To put it another way, you do not have to add fuel to a ship JUST to compensate for the weight of the existing fuel - it is a ratio of the output power of the fuel + the dead weight vs. the necessary escape velocity. > You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel. Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel, and you keep going until it equalizes. This is the key, you can't do this forever, at some point, at some gravity level, i'm sure before 125% more gravity, at our current ability to generate thrust from fuel, we will be unable to make space. That's not how rockets work. A rocket is a giant, hollow tube where over 90% of the mass is the fuel weight. The volume of fuel scales faster than the volume of the container necessary to hold the fuel, so where a rocket that is the size of your arm may only be 50% fuel, a rocket that is the size of the empire state building is going to be well over 90%, and so on. As a result, you are postulating a gravitational world in which exploding fuel is not enough to propel its own mass upward - you are going to have to need much stronger gravity than 2.125X in order to achieve this. Is there a limit to how strong gravity can be and there still be an achievable escape velocity? Yes, for once, it's anticipate a black hole. That has an escape velocity well over the speed of light. Similarly, I'm sure there is an escape velocity that would be unachievable through normal chemical combustion, but its a hell of a lot more than 2.25x earth gravity. Let's put it this way: > You have to remember that to just get 1 more pound into space, you have to add more fuel. Yes. > Then, you have to add more fuel to make up for that weight of the fuel, NO.",1

"But just for kicks here is a current trend for you: Conservative whites in the US are breeding at and above replacement level. That is, over 2.1 child per woman. Do you know what that means? > I do think that notion is far removed from reality. Just like I think the notion of native Americans somehow retaking the US is unrealistic. I don't necessarily think it's okay for indigenous ethnic groups to disappear, I just don't care very much about that and see it as essentially inevitable, at least in certain places. You are making another false equivalence. Native Americans and white Americans are not analogous groups. The matter of changing the ethnic battle in the US to favor whites is mostly a legal one. It is a question of what we as whites allow others to do. Comparing that with native Americans who are a 5 million or so people ""retaking"" the US is childish. If you still feel the notion is far removed I would have to get better justifications than that. (Just on a personal note the idea of white ethnic extinction being inevitable reeks of white submissivism. Such loser mentality is pathetic, weak and disgusting. Go lift some weights.) > Mainly because that's what tends to happen (the problem of induction, I know). My view of the AR is that it's an unpopular fringe movement, do you not see yourself this way? If I had to guess, I would say that the AR causing serious changes is about as likely as the Communist Party USA doing so. The notion of multiracial, multicultural nations was a radical one as well 70 years ago. Yet here we are. The UK leaving the EU was considered radical and openly laughed at 13 years ago, yet here we are. I feel your view on politics and how political change occurs is not very realistic. In most countries far right groups that gain momentum are eaten up by the bigger softer right groups to gain voters. The political will of the far right gets pushed forward that way. The existence of AR talking points spreads even if they don't carry the brand. An example would be UKIP and Nigel Farage pushing Brexit into reality.(not saying either are AR, just an example of fringe political movements reaching their goals.) > I don't know much about Brexit and the AR but Trump has said some pretty unfavorable things[...] maneuvering, doesn't that seem to imply that the AR is at least not going to get any political power in the very near future? The AR doesn't need direct political power to get its will across. But no, to me it does not imply that. No one here expects Spencer and Anglin to be called up for the next administration. We expect guys who hide their power level or guys who do our bidding because they want our votes. The AR brand is unpopular but the ideas behind it are not. > This might be just a semantics difference, but I would probably call that a revolution still, even if it's somewhat of a return to a late state. Returning to the state of nature, for example, I would also call a revolution. Again, a false equivalence. Repealing laws that where put in place 50 years ago is not analogous to returning to the ""state of nature"". I could agree that it is a revolution like the passing of the laws in the first place was a revolution. But the word ""revolution"" in that case sounds inflationary to me. > Isn't the idea of creating an ethnostate where one does not currently exist also relatively untested? The one example I can think of (Israel) has had a lot of conflict. I don't understand where you get the idea that an ethnostate never existed in the US. I already showed you how the US was an ethnostate since its inception up until Hart-Celler in 65'. The ethnostate is the default. Modern day European countries are ethnostates that very recently stopped enforcing their borders and replaced the benefit of the people living within those borders with the benefit of outsiders. Before WW1 almost all countries in Europe where ethnostates like they had been for hundreds of years. The case of Israel is a pointless one since jews never had a country before. The Europeans already have their countries. They just need to enforce their borders and protect their sovereignty from outside influence. It's a question of legal enforcement and not, out of the blue, nation building. Same goes for the US. > Because your options are cede to fight another day or die. [...] I don't think that's a realistic goal, especially given current trends. I disagree with what you think the options are. It is far easier to impact US laws from within the US than it is to secede from the US. But in any case what you are talking about is already happening. There are large groups of whites creating clusters and enclaves around the US. There is no reason to not fight the battle at a local and a national level at the same time. And again, you lean on the current trends like a crutch as if there is no way to reverse them when you can do so easily(look at artificial baby booms in Denmark).",1

"my earlier irritation at your condescension is gone 1) Well, okay. I can't change your mind on this, and quite frankly, I accept some of what you are saying. But a few points. One: alot of these things only have one or two avenues to how they work, based on what we know of them. We know that the Lymans Ear and Neuroglottis are replacements, that the pre-omnor is just a pre-fill sack, etc. There are, in fact, alot of organs one may even consider superfluous. But guess what, you didn't have to read it, and your opinions, whilst sometimes interesting, aren't that constructive. I was setting out to do something for fun; not to change the face of the lore, or facilitate a discussion for you to have. I just wanted to put out some extra info to cover how I think they may work. You can disagree, and you can move on, but devaluing something because it wasn't what YOU wanted at that current time, is more then a little petty. On top of that, people like you are actually preventing many of the speculative options you claim to want, as if my explanations differ even slightly from the lore, it gets lambasted. BTW, the oolotic kidney would likely require a dedicated arterial channel able to intercept the flow of both renal arteries and channel it through the organ and directly into one of the major posterior arteries. There, question answered. 2) You asserted that it would be possible, under a hormone-dependent form of Astartes transformation process (the biscopea and ossmodula functions) for present-day humanity to create something similar. This was meant as a refutation of that concept, based on some of the many, many things we are missing. 3) Hormones can lead to structural changes. This is what you are failing to grasp. Your view of hormone is actually surprisingly limited for someone who claims to have a higher level of scientific understanding then me. Put simply, HGH is one of the key hormone involved in osteogenesis, with its application in that capacity somewhat guided by other hormones, such as estrogen and testosterone. IF we are accepting that the hormone produced by the Ossmodula over-rides these hormones, including the programming hormones, then, should one have a knowledge of genetics and biology far in advance of our own, it would be possible to trigger the Osteoblasts to grow bone in a formation that deviates from the natural human form, thus allowing a higher and denser growth of muscle through specialized artificial growth hormone and myostatin inhibition. This also applies to the expansion of tissue within the internal organs of the body, such as the kidneys, lungs, heart, and circulatory system: growth in vivo is triggered through hormones, and if we substitute human growth hormone for those that create transhuman results (currently an impossibility) then the effect would be to fundamentally alter the biology of the individual. The Astartes, by the way, have never been mentioned as receiving muscular implants. That is not a canon part of the lore, nor would it be particularly useful compared to the growth of muscle going hand-in-hand with unnatural skeletal development. Now that's not to say that it is the only factor, and I never said it was. In fact, I conceded, earlier on, that most organs likely fulfill a secondary function in releasing a targeted retrovirus that enhances the biology by introducing a section of engineered genetic material. But what we know of biology, not just human but animal as well, says that any growth must have a hormonal trigger. You can't refute that. Even if we are dealing with retroviral genetic manipulation, the trigger must still be hormonal in nature. 4) You see, I thought that you were referring to retrovirals as the sole creator. If you are saying it must be a part of the process that goes hand in hand with the hormonal releases of the Ossmodula, we are in agreement. In fact, it would also be one of the best explanations as to why the first implanted organ is the heart: it is the best vector through which to introduce a retroviral gene-modding agent to the host, prepping them for future enhancements and lowering the risk of rejection. Also, my post was mainly focused on what they do when they are functioning. For instance, during function, the Catalespan node is introducing asymmetric neurotransmitters segregated to specific portions of the brain to simulate action in slow-wave sleep (deep sleep). It is the loss of REM that causes psychological problems in the Marine if overuse becomes a factor. 5) Ah, when you said muscle insertions I assumed you meant as a transplant, but you were actually referring to the different sections of the muscle. Now, I will certainly admit that the structure of muscles is governed in no small part by genetics... HOWEVER, the mechanism of action that leads to this change, and its appearance later in life, is, as in all human growth, hormonally based. The genetics of a person determine how the hormonal balance of the body will grow the muscles, not what the completed structure will look like. Now, in regards to the SM's, the structure of these muscles is determined by the Biscopea. The books don't say anything else on the matter, but using that, and an understanding of biology, it is clear that the biscopea controls growth patterns using inhibiting agents, as well as regulating factors that could themselves be inhibitors, such as myostatins. That kind of science is leagues beyond what we have now, and would require the genetics of the individual altered, but, and this is important, no growth of any kind occurs without a biological system producing its action hormonally. 6) Hormones, programmed in, reacting with genetic material predisposed for a certain growth patter, will grow the joints in a different pattern. Now, this is still likely going to share a massive similarity to a human joint, however there will be important differences. Chief among these differences is that the biology of the individual is predisposed to rapid healing and recovery, meaning that what, in a human, would be worn down to nothing is, in an Astartes, constantly replenished. Additionally, the structure of ligaments in the joint will likely include many redundancies that baseline humans lack. For example, the ACL will have additional supporting ligamenture, as well as simply being of a greater material quality. This will be found throughout the rest of the body, most notably in the major skeletal joints. It's actually not that difficult to imagine how these joints would work. In regards to the brain, it depends on what you consider to be a major structural change, and what you consider to be the mode of action of their mental changes. Currently, we can say that the majority of the structure of the Aspirants brain is set in stone when they are inducted; the only major changes to lobe size and structure are the growth of the visual cortex related to the occulobe, the catalespan node, and the Sus'an Membrane. Now, all three of these are major, but their effects wouldn't increase the intelligence of a Marine. Genetic alteration doesn't explain it alone, as, as I have already stated, most growth, including practically all synapse growth, is complete by the time the Aspirant is inducted. Thus, the question becomes; how do you grow the brain? Now, we could argue that there must be a further growth of synapses, but that would require both genetic alteration to reactivate the stem-cell properties of neural tissue (or the addition of stem-cells through, for example, the catalespan node), and hormonal triggers to allow that growth to occur. Alternatively, we could make the case that the major changes to the brain are not grown in, but rather trained in through hypnotherapy, allowing patterns of thought that would be incomprehensible for normal humans to be easily developed. Personally, I have to lean towards a mix of the two, as the Astartes brain needs to process data from various additional organs in an autonomic fashion, and the human brain doesn't have the space for that to occur, but without the correct training on these new centers, administered via hypnotherapy, they would likely be little more then useless chunks of grey matter. 7) Once again, I was doing a thought exercise, and comparing something outside of reality to in-reality counterparts. In some cases, there was nothing to expand on, as the structure of ears is far too complex to speculate about how a perfectly engineered one would present. In regards to their interlocking functions, I don't know, apart from the Biscopea and Ossmodula, what exactly you are referring to. Are you referring to the second hearts interaction with the multi-lung (big surprise, hearts and lungs go together) the larramans organ, or the oolotic kidney (organs whose action is dependent on the circulatory system interact with the organ in the circulatory system)? Is it about the action of the preomnor and the omophagea (there isn't one, the omophagea is in the stomach)? What organ have I failed to recognised to your satisfaction? Let me know. 8) Wikipedias best use in research is as a launching ground into actual reputable sources. 9) You disagree with my assessment of the betchers gland? How so? The glands produce a metal-corrosive venom. In the human body, even stomach acid requires a major mucus membrane to avoid damaging the walls of the stomach, and this is a great deal more corrosive then that. Thus, it must have a form of acid-resistant mucus. When excreting the venom, this mucus must also be excreted to the surrounding area so as to prevent tissue damage. The glands must be operated by a specific muscle group, or they wouldn't be able to shoot the venom at a variable pressure, and the venom must be produced in-gland, because the body lacks a system for transmitting corrosives. What do you think the method of action is? Please understand,",1

"You could save yourself a considerable amount of time by doing more reading comprehension. I didn't say you were incapable of ever changing your mind. Your problem here, as I have tried to point out to you before, is that you are constructing a strawman about what feminism is. I have never heard of the site everdayfeminism, but I am relatively confident that they don't speak for all feminists. You are selectively picking what feminists you want to acknowledge, and then parade around in triumphant when you find they support your conclusion. There are better approaches than the strawman you constructed. For instance, feminists and their organizations have overwhelmingly supported certain politicians. Given that it is unlikely feminists would roundly support a politician if they were not upholding the communities views, it's fair to say that we can take the views of politicians feminists roundly support as a proxy for the views of feminists. At the very least, we can say that the views of politicians feminists roundly support are a better better proxy for the views of feminists than a website you found. Now, you claim that I haven't given you a single instance of a western feminist denouncing how women are treated in Muslim countries. This is an odd claim considering that I have. Again, Barack Obama, a self-identified feminist who was roundly supported by feminists, not only condemned the treatment of women in Muslim countries, but started the campaign against ISIS - even, in part, defending military action on the grounds that ISIS was brutalizing women. If you would like another contemporary example you can look at Hillary Clinton. Clinton famously said, ""women's rights are human rights"" in China, a line that was intended, and taken, as an attack on the sexists policies of the Chinese government and oppressive countries the world over. There are many more example, but I'll stop here. The evidence suggests that your assertion is incorrect. It is simply the case that feminist elect people to office who show great concern for women in oppressive countries. So, there goes the first part of your argument. \> I can't believe anyone would seriously doubt that the vast majority of feminist activists focus on issues that primarily concern women in the West. You as well seem to defend this as morally permissible - so are they not doing it, or are they doing it but it's okay? Pick one. Your confusion here is that I have some obligation to defend either position. I'll I need to do is present counter arguments to your idea that if feminists cared about justice, then they should spend more energy focusing on women in more oppressive countries. There are several good arguments against this idea. One is that feminists already spend a significant portion of their political energy supporting women in the developing world. This has been demonstrated above. Another counter-argument is to say that you can care about justice without spending any of your time supporting women in the developing world. This is fairly easy to defend. There are no social groups in the US that do not have it better than some relevantly similar social group in another part of the world. This has been true since at least the end of WW2, if not before then. Thus, if you want to defend your argument, you must either 1) bite the bullet and say that no political or social movement in the US should be concerned with our affairs, and instead concern themselves with only their worse off peers in the developing world - this includes the civil rights movement, or 2) provide some insight into why feminism is uniquely responsible to take on this task. You have failed to do either, and thus have not made a convincing argument. \> (1) I was a theist, now I am an atheist (2) I am more skeptical of democracy now than I used to be, after reading Brennan's book on the topic.

She didn't just randomly decide to enter the flames in the middle of the burning. Instead, her actions were planned. >Dany is not that dumb, she knows of the value of Barristan and that he is loyal right now She still believed that he betrayed her and her brother, yet she gave him the chance to make amends and he succeeded in that role and was sincere. >It isn't close to what she did to MMD and her followe in the series, she had no reason to keep them alive MMD wasn't a close companion that Dany had traveled with for a long time, moreover she betrayed her in a worse way and her death was meant to play a specific role. >Wrong, in the series one of her handmaidens betrays her while in the books one of them sexes her up...how is that similar?

Simply, Stannis has already burnt people alive who merely refused to go along with burning the symbols of their faith. >Anyway you're the one trying to change the goalpost, our discussion wasn't about STannis method in the first place, it was how this method was applied int he books and in the show No, my point is that Stannis' actions are absolutely wrong and both cases for the fact of the method he employs. I also said I hardly see it worse if the reason he uses his method is because he actually believes in it rather than him doing it all for show. >in teh books he kills traitors coming close to cross the line one time , in the show he kills innocent people without any regard Traitors in the sense that they oppose Stannis' objectives, not because they have been found guilty in any trial (including his own brother). >Cool, I don't share your opnion regarding Dany but I share your regarding Dany, I didn't know Dany and Stannis scenes were so linked for you that by not considering one you automatically doesn't consider the other though Because it ridiculous to say one is some horrible change when it is a vastly less of change than just fabricating scenes. Stannis performs his crimes repeatedly in the books and shows zero remorse while Dany doesn't do any of hers. >And I already talked about Dany scenes, all of them have a scene compatible with them in the books. Only they don't, they are completely made up scenes with no connection to anything happened in the book. Stannis' actions are vastly more compatible. >Dany sentencing her follower to death mirrors what she did to MMD, Dany killing a noble in S5 mirrors her torturing of the shopkeeper in DWD and so on. False, she had much more reasons for why she executed MMD than she did her handmaiden. Torture while messed up morally (Stannis does it also), isn't the same as brutally killing some random person. The Wineseller actually had a connection with some deaths of her Unsullied while that guy had none that the show tells us of. Furthermore, that ordering of sharp questioning came after it being recommended to her by Shavepate before and made in a heated moment. While, the show's actions was cool and calculated move not recommended by anyone and in fact conflicts with her beliefs in episode almost immediately before that one. >It does, unlike Stannis whose attitude towards burnings completely changed in teh series, Dany's attitude wasn't changed so much compared to the books Yeah, Stannis' opinion sure has changed in ASOS he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, in the beginning of ADWD he burns people to please a religion he doesn't believe in, and at the end of ADWD he burns people to please he doesn't believe in. What an amazing change of absolutely nothing. In contrast, to Dany's lack change of where she doesn't do any of that stuff thus she can hardly change her opinion on that matter. Though, we do know that she allows two individuals she believed to betray her have the chance to redeem themselves. >Yet you clearly said he was more blackened compared to the book version Yes, because I am being objective and recognizing some stuff was darkened while other stuff was lightened. >You can call it that but it's better than burning innocents Something Stannis wasn't far off from doing in the books, heck Jon feared that he was going to burn an old military man and a baby so much that he was forced to take drastic action. >Anyway, burning people for some religion you believe is what Vic does, Stannis is doing it as a method of execution you can call it cruel as muc as you want (while truthfully every death is cruel) at least it's better than burning innocents Both are utterly horrible, and they are more similar to each other than just made up scenes with no connection to the books. >Not just wants, he is ""begging"" for sex which completely makes no sense if you take book Stannis into account It doesn't conflict with anything about book:Stannis, we know that after BW he was desperate and we know they have sex.

[Insert meaningless Drake Equation calculation based on more assumptions.]” 3) Now that they've improperly set the rules, the ""skeptics"" over there can (as you're trying to do here with Bayes' Theorem) eliminate the strangest elements of any strong UFO case by simply appealing to probability -- ""overall it's much more likely that the object was an aircraft, and we've found some hugely improbable yet mundane event that could almost semi-plausibly explain that element of this UFO case. And therefore (because UFOs are improbable, remember?), all this other evidence can be dismissed, too. So, in conclusion, the UFO in this case must have just been an aircraft."" Tada! Case solved! (And note that the people over there 100% do consider themselves to have solved the RB-47 case. Amazing....) 4) And now we get to the part some self-labeled skeptics love the most: sit and wait, while impatiently drumming their fingers, for the UFOlogists -- UFOlogists who are almost entirely part-time and amateurish, necessarily -- to provide the skeptics with the ""extraordinary evidence"" that would be needed in order to prove that true UFOs are real. It's just so easy. And ignores so much.... world class of all, why are amateurs and not scientists doing the ""proving"" here? Could amateurs even possibly meet that burden?",1

"using that as an excuse to bang on the dictionary, and expect people to be as terrified of it as of politicians courting the alt-right, is manipulative semantic trick to portray two vastly different situations under the same blanket. In practice, when you have to argue that your terminology is right ""by the dictionary definition"", it's often because we all understand that it would be misleading by any other more intuitive definition. The dictionary exist to sort words out, not to give authoritive guidance on their subtleties. It will help you look up which is ""receipt"" and which is ""recipe"", or what is the greek-based word for ""rule by a few"", but it will hardly help you in reading the social context of which is the absolute most appropriate word to use. This subreddit is full of posts where people try to argue that tehnically they are right to apply a certain word to an action. ""Piracy is theft"". ""Abortion is murder"". ""Taxation is theft"". ""Affirmative Action is racist"" ""Avatar is an Anime"". ""Chess is a sport"". These arguments often boil down to picking a thing that is partially example of a larger label, but in some ways it is also an outlier example compared to the most iconic central examples that the label evokes. These arguments' goal is not to bringing up new, unknown information about their subject matters, but abusing the dictionary so a thing will be looked at differently if we categorize it together with a larger label. (No one is raising new scientific data of what an abortion involves, just that we should frown upon it because the dictionary applies the same word to it, as to a man shooting you in the face) In the case of racism, we all understand, that the term ""racism"" was popularized as a description of nazi politics, and the way it ideologically motivated by a belief in racial hierarchies. Later it got applied to American white supremacist politicians, who rejected the term, taking it as an unfair accusation. So it entered the discourse as that, as an accusation of an intended oppressive political agenda. Even if today, you can find dictionaries that for brevity's sake define racism just as ""negative beliefs about a race"", or somethig like that, it is undeniable that the term is dripping with a heavy accusation, that the one called ""racist"" is about to bring back the Bad Old Days. Which makes it different from having negative beliefs about a hair color, or about a body height, or about a city of origin. Those are prejudices too, but on a different level from racism, without carrying the same ruinous threat of oppression. In many ways, minorities having collectively negatively argument about white people, is more similar to those, than to white racism.

As we all learned in civics class in luxuriously school, the rights of one person end where the rights of another person begin. You seem to be (and please correct me if I am misunderstanding) defining control of women as meaning placing any limitations on her whatsoever.

I am opposed to the former, but in favor of the latter. But I wouldn't define such limitations as ""controlling women"", any more than I would say that telling a thief he can't steal is placing limitations on the thief.

You keep pointing to extreme examples of people who want to, as you say, end enforcement of child support, or call women who want to get abortions nasty names.

"decreasing their lending, thus shrinking the money supply While you have a point to make, there are several errors in your thinking here. First, the definition of inflation involves rising prices. That may usually involve movement in the money supply or not, but that doesn't change the definition of the word. Second, inflation is not always caused by an increase in the money supply, and an increase in the money supply does not always cause inflation. For an example of the latter point, consider a liquidity trap and Japan over the 1990's. Increase the money supply is irrelevant in a situation with zero interest rates because defy money is equivalent to defy bonds, and so it may be very difficult to generate inflation despite a wild increase in the money supply. For an example of the former, consider weather shocks that increase the cost of food, or global demand shocks that increase the cost of natural resources.

"Just to humor you. I'm actually a Psych graduate who worked in HR. > We’ve been doing that for months in regards to ToB. > We’re not asking for huge engine overhauls or features that CA have never implemented. The vast majority of criticism has been about CA removing features that were already in previous games. How is it unrealistic to want them to, you know... not remove something they’ve used in the past? At this point I’ve given up wanting CA to put in cool new features because I know they won’t, so really all I want is for them to just not get rid of things that worked in the past, but even that is a lost cause now. Not really. In previous months, if you look at certain opinions, there's a disparity in player reception. For instance, players clamored for an explanation why ambushes were being removed; u/Jack_CA eventually gave an answer after arriving at the office (as he had promised). In the official TW forums, the reception was understanding - players understood the reason for removing the feature, and were moving forward. When Jack explained it here on Reddit, the reception was a bit more critical - players did not understand why it had to happen; they kept asking 'why' (even though that was already answered). Some insisted that 'it should be easy to make these changes'; some espoused the slippery-slope argument such as 'what if CA streamlined all features so we only have 1 building and 1 unit in future games'. Others in a knee-jerk reaction felt that this was a betrayal of the community, or that Thrones was already the worst game in the franchise. And finally, a couple of people decided to call for boycotts because these were 'dark times for the TW franchise'. So yes - people here wanted an answer, they got one, they were angry because they didn't like it. ----------- In the old days (cough - 90's, early-2000's, pre-social media/streaming/blogs) - we used to criticize games after we had experienced them, or and we often took critic opinions with a grain of salt. Today, we criticize games after we hear about them from someone else, almost espousing the ideas presented by certain critics - who are, more often than not, fellow gamers like us. In effect, this leads people to believe that 'removing features in order to focus on new ones' is a bad thing - even though the Saga-series is considered an 'experimental one to look into other areas that TW can delve into'. Here's a more detailed explanation on how our criticism of games has changed over the years. And here's another one about how opinions/critique has changed based on the landscape of the media/social platforms nowadays. ------- > Yep, and that’s why they’re paid to work as game developers and programmers and not fast food employees. You seriously can’t keep dismissing every criticism or suggestion with “well you can’t do it so give them a break” or “well it’s hard, don’t expect too much”. And it's also not an idea of - 'hey it's hard, don't expect too much' - it's a case of 'it's hard, so set your expectations properly'. There's a key difference there. The moment the average gamer feel that certain steps are easy to do, even though they are not - whether it's due to the game's engine, or programming issues, or the game's overall direction - the average gamer then sets more unrealistic expectations layered on top of the other. Take a look at Destiny for instance. Gamers initially wanted improvements to the system because the sequel was disappointing; next thing you know, people wanted Destiny 1 to come back. If the developer tries to go back to that system, people then ask 'why it's taking so long', or 'why did they even try to change in the first place'. In essence - it does not lead to anything constructive because people are still stuck dwelling on the past ('why did these things happen?') rather than providing -realistic and level-headed- feedback that allows the game to move forward. Here's a topic about how to provide constructive criticism for developers as written by an independent developer. Notice how it also points out how we should assume certain changes are difficult, and that we should not get stuck thinking of the 'why' (things happened). ------------ > Please stop talking like a HR graduate.

Even that's an absurd oversimplification, because there's so much fucking history and variables contributing to the colossal clusterfuck that is the Middle East, but learning about stuff is hard, and we know a lot of Western Europe and America (let's just say NATO or America because it's hard to think about stuff when assigning blame) has had their fingers in the Middle East and caused at least some of the discord with the way they've supported certain regimes and aided the overthrow of others in different countries, so let's just say instead that NATO is to blame for everything in the Middle East.",1

"I hope this help. TIL that reddit doesn't know that Taoism, Confucianism and Buddhism are not religions. They are ethical systems of conduct, not worship. If anything, each one is more of a psychology on how to live a balanced life than a religion. Religion is defined as: the belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power, esp. a personal God or gods. How do any of the aforementioned philosophies fit that definition? The Tao is not a force to worship, but a force to understand. It's something to be aware of and recognize in order to help you live a better life. Same with Buddhism. The major tenants of it propose that people recognize their suffering and what causes it--usually, some sort of fond regard to objects, feelings, etc. Confucianism is nothing more than Aesop's tales in an Asian style. Again, all of these are ideologies of living a good life. Which, imo, has nothing to do with religion because it's not dependent on anything outside of one's self. Think of them as Socrates. Wise words to live by regardless of the origin or source. Religion, not so much. Christianity, e.g., is all about the trinity and resurrection.

Your subnet mask is 255.255.255.0 and your gateway is 192.168.0.1.

"this point doesn't knock down or answer the question at hand: If humans lack the ability to judge God's moral integrity, then how can you say that your god is good? > You're gonna get a whole lot of push-back on this, considering that's a question that has been debated intensely in science fiction for a long time. If those robots are sentient, sapient, and capable of moral judgments, self-directed actions, and independent reproduction, how can it be moral to MURDER them based solely on the idea that a person created the FIRST one? >The analogy doesn't break down at all. It stays strong, as far as I see it, and it strikes at the heart of the issue: the morality of God. The fact that I create something cannot inherently justify my decision to destroy it. The case for destruction has to come from some other line of reasoning. >An example: I invent a cheap, effective cure for leukemia. Is it moral of me to destroy it and prevent the benefit to the world simply because I am its maker? Of course not. >Creation does not inherently justify destruction on a whim. Therefore, the destructive acts of God must be morally justified using some other line of reasoning, or else deemed immoral or amoral. What about any of the above demonstrates an attitude, and what ""attitude"" is that? Absolutely nothing, as far as I can see.

I didn't use an ad hominem argument, I didn't personally attack you, and I didn't threaten you. I laid out my argument logically and civilly. Your complaints about my ""attitude"" are nothing but a whine. Stop whining. >The reason the robot analogy is so weak is because it presents a scenario where the 'created' and the 'creator' are too similar. No, they're not. It isn't even necessary for them to share any qualities. As long as the created object possesses the traits I outlined, It cannot be moral to justify destruction solely on a whim using creation as a standard. That is why the robot analogy is the correct one. >A more accurate scale to Christianity, (or even to OP's premises), would be... 'as a grain of sand is to the Milky Way, so humans are to God'. Now you're making a host of category errors. The difference between humans and a grain of sand is that we think, feel, and make value judgements. As long as that is true, humans are moral beings. This is why the robot analogy applies, while the leukemia cure and sand analogies break down at this level. All your argument amounts to is the statement that ""God is such a greater moral being than us that we can't judge his morality."" If that is true, and we have no reference by which to judge God's morality, then you can't determine if he is good or bad. Calling your god ""good"" or ""bad"" is inherently a moral judgment, which, as you've argued, you cannot make about him because of your own limited moral understanding. Thus, your argument has pulled the rug out from under your own feet, and you can no longer say ""God is good."" Once you lose the ground to argue that ""God is good,"" how do you claim that your god is worthy of worship, if he exists? > If we accept the basic philosophical definition of God as 'a being such that no greater being can possibly be conceived of' This is a completely untenable definition. It simply doesn't work. 1) Define ""greater."" The word is meaningless outside of a defined context of measurement. One is greater than negative two in value, but negative two is greater than one in magnitude. What is the essence of the greatness you're talking about? Is it size? Power? ""Goodness""? The word ""greatest"" doesn't mean anything on its own, it is a modifier that must be qualified by a context. Your ""greatness"" is an undefined concept, and so all you've done is try to define your god into unfalsifiability by retreating behind some other vague term. 2) Once you define ""greatness,"" your definition will inherently lead to an infinite regress. Any standard of greatness can be incrementally increased. As such, any proposed ""greatest"" example can simply be incremented again, using the same standard of greatness. This is the philosophical underpinning of the concept of infinity. Our conceptions are unlimited in this regard, so positing God as the upper limit here is nonsensical. There is always a greater infinity that can be conceived of. 3) The Christian god is already defined, and your definition does not comport to the preexisting one. The Christian god is defined by his attributes and actions as outlined in the Bible. That god which is outlined in the Bible is certainly not the greatest being that I can imagine, so your definition forces us to reject the god of the Bible. 4) Even if you can prove that your definition isn't nonsensical, you would still have to demonstrate that the greatest being of which we can conceive actually exists in order to refer to his moral integrity in any kind of sensible way. >You've referred to humans as 'lesser moral beings', and God as a 'greater moral being'. This is exactly the same error that I made in the robot analogy by referring to the robot maker's actions as moral. It seems that you have already pre-judged the moral integrity of God as well. This appears to be an admission that it is impossible to judge the morality of God's actions as either good or bad. Humans are moral beings because they think, feel, and make value judgments. This inherently creates a moral framework in which we live. Does God think, feel, and make value judgments? The Bible indicates he does, so he would have to be a moral being. You yourself have gone on about how God is the ""greatest being that can be conceived of."" This definition cannot result in any conclusion other than God is a greater moral being than humans.

"I do not expect you to actually read those articles, much less comprehend them. I see you added on to your message, and it’s the usual flaccid “YKIIARR” claptrap.

It is really difficult and indeed psychologically unnatural to claim that you hate an ideology without hating the people in whose lives it is expressed.

A common defense used by those making prejudice statements regarding Muslims has been to claim that 'Islam is not a race', this doesn't fly with comedian Ben McLeay who says that, besides it being weird that they think that their 'mis-categorisation' is a defense excusing their bigotry, it actually doesn't make them any less racist. > If I had a dollar for everyone someone has told me “Islam isn’t a race” in the last week, I probably wouldn’t currently be two months behind on my internet bill. Delivered every single time by someone confident that they’re the first person to ever say it to me, it’s a sentence invariably used to argue that someone’s anti-Muslim sentiment isn’t the product of racism, and therefore totally fine. > The worst people alive are crawling out of the woodwork to comment exactly this sentence on every single article about Sonia Kruger and Pauline Hanson they can find, hoping that people will stop mistaking their hate speech for dangerous racism and instead acknowledge it as run-of-the-mill, harmless religious discrimination. > Islam is estimated to constitute a full 45% of the population of Africa, and our dear friends to the north, Indonesia, have the largest Muslim population of any country in the world.

You have a very uneducated concept of how vital crude oil is to daily life at present. Plastic was just an example of an oil byproduct.

I never argued that the extremist stance taken in the documentary was fact. It's merely presenting data from a guy who's job it was to figure these things out. And he's paranoid because of it.

The premise of what I'm saying isn't ""men don't owe you friendship except the[y] kinda sorta do,"" despite the fact that - if it were - it would be easier for you to discredit my opinion. What my point is, and has been, is that rejecting someone's friendship - especially if that friendship is established before and/or without a concurrent sexual relationship - on the basis that the person doesn't want to sleep with you, is not cool. I am not postulating that anyone owes anyone friendship.

I assumed you would not actually find those things a turn on - that was my point. Most people, because of an instinct to seek genetic variance, would find such examples repulsive. I don't need to present evidence beyond centuries of the illegality of incest for that one. The Crastor's wife thing may have sounded rude, but I was just referring to the hottest series on tv right now - which also happens to be full of incest. Perhaps that was silly to include. I'm just saying that our morals probably have some basis in instinct, and instinct says incest is always wrong. Weird in nature is wrong. As we become more sophisticated individually as well as societally, weird becomes more understandable, sometimes more acceptable, but on principle ""weird"" is what everybody says is weird, regardless of what you or I think.

"With all that said, I've seen way more hate on FO4 than BF so far. I think you're being selective on what you're paying attention to. I had no idea anyone could enjoy a game that is so void of content. It has eleven guns. It's online only, when the community dies so does the game. The only reason It has length is the fact that you earn almost no points every match, guns take forever to unlock. They're shoving the season pass down our throats that will undoubtably contain a few more EXCLUSIVE maps that are uninspired, haphazard, and boring. You just run and gun. That's all there is to it. Run around as fast as you can and shoot as many people as you can before you die. No one plays the objectives which makes every match feel like a variation on team deathmatch. DICE has never had problems making their games run like fucking silk. This isn't a surprise. If I wanted a game that's only saving grace was the optimization I'd play minesweeper all day. Battlefront is simply lacking in every area, it feels like an early access game with a functioning engine instead. Like they're planning on refining the maps and adding flyable vehicles that spawn rather than pickups later. But instead they took battlefield, removed the guns, legitimate map variety, and vehicles and then slapped a star wars skin on it. Fallout is FAR from perfect. If you look at my comment history I've been having issues since day 1 on a monster of a system. But I'll be damned if the game isn't compelling. It's fun. It has hours worth of content, hundreds of thousands of area to explore. It has a unique and interesting atmosphere, full of characters that propel rewarding and fulfilling quests. It has a level up system that has proper pacing rather than how long you grind for. And it is genuinely fucking fun to play. We can talk about engines and optimization and bad business practices all day but at the end of it all, the only thing that matters is whether or not the game is fun to play. Just look at DayZ, Ark: Survival Evolved, GTA:V, and many more... Whether it's Their engines fucking sucking, the devs being awful, or modding getting you banned... people will still love to play them.",1

I noted that you're setting the frame for a presumption of materialism, which makes it perhaps too easy to conclude materialism. >The existence of imaginary numbers is inferred based on the existence of real numbers The key thing is inferred. Great. They were inferred that way. But they were not observed. The existence of imaginary numbers is not predicated on real numbers existing. One could imagine any number of other routes by which they could be discovered. And they are discovered, not invented. Likewise, Pi would be an irrational number even if humans had never existed. It's existence is a transcendent truth, knowable through reason, not through observation. These are objective truths, and truths more certain than any observation of the real world. As I said before, this would be impossible if the truth of mathematical proofs was predicated on observations, as they would be strictly less than or equal to the reliability of the observations. >You're misapplying your terms. I'm not the one who said ""Argument from Ignorance"" when one's grounds for an argument were pointed out. >Its not objectively true in and of itself. It is.

When communicating with the stars, we look for things like prime numbers and so forth as a means by which to see an artificial signal.

I will absolutely agree with you that if all there is to knowledge is empirical observation, as you imply with your ""reliable measurements"", then we can have no knowledge of things outside the universe. But as we've seen, this is not actually the case. We can deduce the existence of things outside of the universe, in much the same way that you claimed we can infer imaginary numbers from real numbers! >Your the one attacking reason based on evidence by purporting indeterminate conjecture as if it constitutes proof Conjecture is not proof. Please do not confuse the two. If I prove that 2+2 = 4 under, say, ZFC set theory, then I have proven it. It is not conjecture. I suppose you might try to dismiss a proof that you don't like as conjecture, but this is an irrational line of attack. If a proof is provided to you, you can attack the premises, or you can attack the line of reasoning. You can't just say that because it's a proof, it is conjecture, as you do here. These are not the same things. >You can't make claims up from scratch and claim they're valid Not true. Validity is can be quite easy to demonstrate using terms I just made up: All A are B. All B are C. Therefore, all A are C. Perhaps you meant to say soundness? >Stating that god is timeless and eternal is not a rational or logical claim in any sense of those terms. Is is the conclusion, not an assumption. So this argument doesn't apply. >And without evidence, neither side can know. A logical proof is a form of evidence. And a more certain one than the empirical observations that you seem to be in a monogamous relationship with. >I'd say its ironic that you, a theist, is trying to re-frame the terms evidence and knowledge in order to purport your fake knowledge Evidence and knowledge have definitions. Evidence is something that can be used to support a claim. An argument is a claim supported by evidence. Knowledge is a true justified belief(). And so forth. Nowhere in those definitions does the fine print read, ""...and only reliable measurements are allowed"". This absurd insistence that a form of evidence, with only modest levels of confidence, is the only form of evidence is not only a logical fallacy you make, but is the cancerous irrationality that lurks at the heart of modern atheism. >Logic is not divine providence! If your argument can't stand up on its own merit, then it shouldn't. This quote describes your failure, not mine. There's no reason outside of your cognitive dissonance to believe in an archaic faerie tale. And asserting that as truth or evidence is a blatant lie. The terms you're using mean the exact opposite of how you're applying them. You're actually describing something that theists do, not atheists, to justify their silly beliefs. You're conflating the boundary between words and actions so that anything you feel seems plausible by purporting a mind before matter argument. But that's an egocentric defense mechanism. Just because you need to believe something doesn't make it real. And you've still skirted around the original question refused to support why you think ""god is eternal and timeless,"" actually constitutes knowledge. Without evidence, its no more valid than believing in unicorns. This entire paragraph is a classic example of someone working through cognitive dissonance. You think you're a smart person, but your thought system isn't apparently capable of understanding how a logical proof could be used to support a claim, despite that being, the definition of what a proof is.

Just as the United States is responsible for for both good and evil, writing it off as a criminal organization would disregard the good that it has done throughout history. You ask how can I presume that I am right about my current thought, in the same manner, how do we know that psychologists, physicists, literary analysts, etc., are right about there thought today? Theology is just as valid of a institutional field of study as any of those, and through this scholarship, a more accurate interpretation and understanding of its content is achieved. Now are my views the final say on the Christian tradition? No, just as scientific thought today will eventually be seen as being antiquated, so will current Theological thought. However, as Theology progresses, it will definitely build upon the ideas in use today. In regard to your point concerning slavery and violence, when looking at its historical context, the Hebrew culture promoting slavery and violence was hundreds of years ahead of its time in terms of human rights. If you do a study on slavery within the Hebrew nation versus the study of other nations in the Ancient Near East, you will quickly see that the Hebrews were downright humanitarian. Also, the condoning of slavery was not the final word of the Hebrew scripture, rather as the society progressed, slavery eventually became condemned. In order to see and understand this, a person must be very familiar with the meta-narrative of the Old Testament and the history of its development. Finally, by saying that you would not act in a certain way if you were God, is providing an anthropomorphic version of God. God is not human any more than you are God, and attributing human motives to God is mistaking the fundamental nature of God as being finite. Once again,",1

As I already said, I think that Sirlin's insights are generally applicable. More options does not necessarily increase depth in a single-player game, either. Sid Meier describes a game as a set of interesting decisions; if those decisiveness favor some options over others, then they become less interesting. > With that in mind, having more options is rarely a bad thing, because they afford the player more flexibility in how he wants to play the game. That's abdicating responsibility. Yes, the player can choose between different options; but it's the responsibility of the developer to make sure that the choice between those options is interesting and fun.

"Finally, don't get a pony bottle. It's extra gear (more points of failure), requires you to master a set of skills (deploying the pony reg in an emergency) that you should not bother with until you have mastered dive planning, safe ascents and OOA drills, and worse The best thing you can do is learn to plan your dive and dive your plan. PADI teaches you how to avoid getting bent. But most new divers won't approach their NDL limits unless they're doing deep repetitive dives (like 3+ dives per day <100 fsw). New divers have gas consumption rates that are simply too high to let them get close to NDL unless they're diving doubles. You need to learn how to write a safe dive plan, which means understanding how your consumption rate will affect how much time you can spend in the three phases of the dive - descent, dive ops, ascent, while still retaining sufficient gas to act as an emergency reserve for your buddy, and having enough gas left in the tank to avoid dropping below the minimum necessary for the tank to remain in a ""safe"" condition (i.e. 500psi). Once you know how to craft a dive plan the next thing you need to learn to do is how to conduct a safe ascent. Safe ascents from 30fsw to the surface require you to master the art of hitting a fixed depth and holding that depth without rising or falling in depth for a pre-determined amount of time. Ideal safe ascents begin at 30fsw and increment in 5 foot units for 1 minute per all the way to the surface. Finally, the third thing you need to do is practice your Out of Air (OOA) drills with your buddy. You should both become comfortable enough with the procedure that you can do it without altering your depth. You can combine these drills with your safe ascents when you're good enough at holding depth to manage it. Basically until you have reached a level of proficiency with your skills and knowledge about dive planning, you aren't going to become a safer diver. The Rescue Diver class, by the way, isn't about making you a safer diver. It's about teaching you the skills you will need to respond if someone else has an accident or a health emergency. There are cracking parts of the Rescue Diver curricula including learning/refreshing CPR and how to make a site-specific emergency plan, and I encourage you to take it, but just remember that the class is about helping others not helping you.",1

"When faced with an argument or debate on topics where you have no knowledge the sane, rational, productive, and I dare say even the polite thing to do is either hold your tongue or ask questions of experts and professionals to learn more about it. You mightiness want to get a cup of tea or something because this is going to take a while to explain all of your logical errors and misunderstandings though I hope we come out of this ahead. Yes most aspects of agriculture won't directly involve you just as most activities on the planet are ""things other people did"". It's a logical error to assert actions of others don't impact you as indirect impacts can be of the very same severity as direct ones. The impact of ""other people"" not growing enough food in our society is exactly the same as if you didn't grow/hunt enough yourself in a subsistence society. The only reason you or anybody else for that matter is alive is because of things other people did. The people who invented crop rotation, the people who figured out through the study of evolution that genetic diversity is critical to reducing famine, if these things didn't happen there is a good chance you wouldn't be here (probably the largest impact of all). Now for your analogy - accounting does have an incredible impact on your life, once again you're assuming something doesn't simply because you know nothing of it, a case of prideful ignorance if ever I saw. Apart from the fact that even medium sized businesses couldn't function without accounting you also have the direct impacts associated with accounting gone bad, for example the Enron accounting scandal which wiped $2 billion from the pensions of their 20,000 employees was a pretty direct impact for them. And yes, as a society we do require the teaching of mathematics which is a fundamental requirement for accounting, just as evolution is a fundamental requirement for biology. Also yes we would prevent the teaching of non-mathematical based systems of accounting because just like with evolution there is no alternate theory of accounting. We would never take seriously a superstitious approach to accounting such as throwing goat bones and interpreting from how they land the value of our liquid assets. Another massive logical fault in your argument is that of knowing about something being equal to impact_. You said ""the average person need know nothing about anyone else's trade"" and that somehow that denotes a lack of impact. You don't know how to run a power plant I assume but you'd certainly see the impact of a power outage just as nobody cares if what you think about the impact of evolution but you'd feel the impact pretty quickly if you didn't have food or medicine. For the last point I think it's extremely clear that the opinions of unqualified people do not matter - I don't ask my plumber for a medical assessment and physicists won't take a democratic vote to determine the value of 'c'. In fact in almost any profession you care to check (except politics) systems are devised to keep ridiculous and uninformed ideas from muddying the pool. This is precisely where the term experts comes into play. If you aren't aware how evolution impacts the world, or how accounting has contributed to the large scale growth of societies, then why would your opinion on any of these topics be worth anything at all, the supreme arrogance here is in your hubris that you should be listened to even when speaking from a megaphone of unqualified ignorance.",1

Why can't the messy conflicts be due to the reasons I've proposed?

It does not and cannot stand alone as it says many times that misplaced faith is just as bad as no faith at all. 2: I'm defining faith thusly: >Faith -The inherent belief that anything told to us by claim of Jesus or otherwise is inherently true and requires no further analysis. This faith is more important than reason because it's deeper, and therefore it can be at direct odds with logic or evidence and still be true. 3: Obviously, there's a difference between our definitions of faith. >As you can see, actual the faith we have as Christians is much different than the way you are defining it.

Many liberals will try to offer the difference in wealth as some sort of evidence that black people are oppressed. My response, naturally, which i consider to be totally reasonable...is that black people have on average 15 less iq than whites...they drop out of school far more often than whites...they commit crime more often than whites..they have children out of wedlock more often than whites...none of this is behavior is good for building wealth, and none if it is the fault of white people.",1

"it just means that they haven't been willing to put in the necessary effort to MAKE it work Well, since Buddhism in general is a hard path, I don't see anything strange about the majority of members quitting, and I don't really think that says much about the practice either way. And of COURSE you can achieve your goals and determinations without Nichiren Buddhism. I don't think anything is a one size fits all--it is just an ""expedient means"" that suits some people and not others--there are many expedient means, and many different paths to enlightenment. And as for positive visualization making you more likely to fail--well... both yes and no, depending on how the visualization is done. When you engage in pure positive visualization and just bask in the glow of your imagined future success, and leave it at that--yes, you are absolutely right, studies have shown that this can be counterproductive. The scientific explanation I read is that your mind/body, on the most basic level, can't tell the divergence between an imagined experience and a real experience. When you actually achieve a goal, your body releases a little hit of dopamine, which leads to the pleasurable feelings of reward. When you just visualize achieving the goal then, you still get that little hit of dopamine, and get some of that positive feeling of reward--but without actually doing the work. Because you already got some of the reward you were seeking, but without having to expend effort, this leaves you less motivated to achieve than before. (This is a super over-simplified explanation). BUT, if you visualize yourself achieving your goal and then make sure to CONTRAST it to the undesirable situation of the way things are now, it causes this hit of dopamine to then be countered by the chemicals that produce more negative feelings. What happens then, is that you associate achieving your goal with the feeling of pleasure, but you are immediately reminded of your dissatisfaction with the current state of things. This mental contrast, as opposed to pure positive visualization, has been shown to INCREASE motivation and effectiveness. (This research was cited in the book The Procrastination Equation, which was a recent, popular book by a research psychologist on the subject of defeating procrastination. It delved into areas like increasing motivation and willpower, how to effectively change habits, how to get yourself to work effectively towards achieving your goals, etc.--and it presented research to back up the strategies it recommended. As for the practical benefits of mindfulness in increasing happiness, helping to modulate emotions, improving ""distress tolerance"" (the ability to withstand very painful negative emotions without resorting to unhealthy coping mechanisms like escapism, regression, denial, etc.). Mindfulness (which is usually practiced/rehearsed by regular practice of various meditation techniques) seems to be of value in improving overall life effectiveness, see research on Dialectical Behavioral Therapy and Mindfulness Based Therapy--two newer forms of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy that are considered to be ""Evidence Based Treatments"" (meaning they have science to back their effectiveness). As chanting a mantra is an established meditative technique in MANY religions and philosophies, I don't see how chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo would not have the same benefits that other forms of meditation seem to provide. Research suggests that regular meditation slows cognitive decline, increases neuroplasticity reduces stress, and reduces the symptoms of depression and anxiety, among other positive benefits. If for nothing else than THAT, the practice would have a positive effect. I also don't see how a philosophy that has you take responsibility for yourself and for the consequences of your own actions is a negative one?And as I mentioned before, having this ""inner locus of control""--is believed to reduce levels of depression, and increase your likelihood of achieving your goals. (There is extensive research on this, too--it is one of those concepts that is included in just about every psych textbook.) I am genuinely curious as to why you are so negative about the SGI? Look, I'm not pushing the religion. I honestly don't care if others practice or not-- to each his own--... I mean, I was raised Catholic. Catholicism isn't for me, but my mother is quite devout, and more power to her if it makes her happy,,,I feel the same way about Nichiren Buddhism and the SGI I am curious as to what harm the SGI did to you, and how the religion hurt you so much that you feel compelled to denounce it and be a ""whistleblower""? BTW--studies show that 95% of people who join AA quit as well, but for the 5% of people who stay, it works great. Its kind of one of those ""it works for the people it works for"" situations, and that is how I see the SGI. I also think that whether the SGI helps you improve your life, or whether it leads to self-delusion, ineffectiveness and stagnation, largely depends on your mindset and how you interpret the philosophy--and also on whether you actually put the teachings into action or you just passively expect chanting alone to fix everything...basically, I think it comes down to whether you walk the walk or just talk the talk Like, I have this friend in the practice who chants for a couple hours a day, and has done so for 20 years, and he was just complaining to me recently, not understanding why he wasn't getting any benefits, wondering why his life sucked so much...the thing is, he chants a lot, but he taes NO positive action. He makes bad causes constantly, creating terrible consequences for himself. If you aren't even going to try to LIVE by the principle that what you do now creates your future, then why in the hell would you bother chanting ""devotion to the mystical law of Karma"" over and over again? After all, you are proving by your negative actions that you are not devoted to the concept of Karma in the least!!

"Finally, my final statement about consistently landing lvl 3 Seathed Attacks isn't me being ""full of shit"", is the bread-and-butter Greatsword tactic and what every single Greatsword player says to new Greatsword wielders all around the Internet. It's no secret that consistently landing those sweet lvl 3 attacks increases your damage output by a landslide, and at the end of the quest they give more overall damage than simply smashing the X and A buttons alternately like if you were weaving a flag. You know what? You're being pretty rude. I'm just posting what my experience has been with the GS weapons based on my own kill times as a lonehunter on 3DS, and what I've seen around the web. But if you want solid numbers, here they are: http With Crit Draw and Sharpness +1, Nero's Anguish and Cera Cymmetry are pretty much tied for the best Greatswords. No circumstantial info, no playstyle involved. Raw numbers. Myxo Demolisher is still a great weapon for early-mid G-Rank, but Nero and Cera are better. Pretty much every single forum post, discussion, guide and game story, agree on those two weapons. And look, no trash talking! EDIT: after reading beyond all that tryhard speech, you are putting a lot of words in my mouth. First of all, Slime has a CHANCE to proc with each attack. Of course you CAN have more procs with the right skills, leading to more explosions on certain quests. That's just a statistical fluctuation. Cherry-picking two videos as a proof isn't conclusive at all. Again, I proposed 2-3 blows per quest as a rough estimate for all the grinding I've done with my own Myxo Demolisher. Second, YOU started talking about speedrunning. Again, speed killing heavily depends on your playstyle, but in GENERAL TERMS (as I said), faster weapons which can exploit idle times, elemental weaknesses and/or status are better for speedrunning than Myxo Demolisher as a solo hunter, specially because monsters build resistance to Slime the more you apply to them. That means less frequent explosions for a weapon with the same damage potential. I proposed Spectral Demolisher as the best Brachydios weapon for this, NOT as the best speedrunning weapon. Also, stop cherry-picking videos over Youtube. Isolated cases aren't proof of a statistical tendency. Third, Cera Cymmetry needs Crit Draw because the skill adds 100 affinity to your seathed attacks, that means that instead of having a 20% prospect of whiffing your Seathed Attack (and considerably lowering your burst damage potential), you have an 80% prospect of dealing insane damage with that same seathed attack.",1

No; there are two differences that came to light since then. The first is that where these stat blocks came from are explained to the OP who stated that he just googled stats and used them. The stats I recommended come from a 25 point bribe and I linked the calculator and told him to play with the calculator. The second is that they're more realistic for a character to actually possess, and easier to roleplay. Having 3 dump stats is a pain in the ass to RP and it's obvious cheese most GMs don't want to put up with. It's an unrelated note to the class nerf.

Yeah, I said that. But they don't choose one or two things to get good at, at the exclusion of everything else.

"I'm sorry that your local FD has left you with a bad taste in your mouth, but god forbid you or someone you love has a real emergency, would you want those guys tied up saving someone's cat? herein lies the issue.. cat is 30 feet up. Generally speaking, extension ladders carried by many FD's are less than 30 feet. Some departments carry laders that are 30+ but they are unwieldy and need several people to set up and use safely (5 people). Also, a ladder truck with one of their ladders in use is (at least where I served) is considered ""out of service"" until said ladder can be taken down and secured back on the truck. So if they use a portable 30+ ladder, the truck is out of service until the cat recovery is completed or the big ladder can be taken down and secured. 99.99% of the time, that won't be an issue. but that .001% where a crew was late responding to an active problem due to the cat could possibly delay a rescue operation, and in a worst case scenario, a human fatality. In that unlikely, but ever present case, the FD would be crucified publicly. ""but what about a ladder truck that has a large ladder mounted on the top of a truck that can be controlled by hydraulics by one guy? Why not use that instead of the 5 man, 30+ foot portable?"" Glad you asked. As a safety measure, ladder trucks cannot deploy a mounted ladder without first jacking the truck up on hydraulic stabilizers. The ladder controls will not function until 4 (generally), independently controlled jacks are set and the sensors on the truck tell the computer that deployment of the ladder is safe. To be frank, it takes some time to deploy (and subsequently retract) any fixed ladder system, once again, putting the ladder truck ""out of service"" for those critical few minutes in that 99.99% chance that something goes very wrong for someone else (IE: their house is on fire). Now, when you made contact with the FD and they were eating dinner, yes at that moment they were probably relaxing and having some tasty grub. And there is a very good chance that in the time they were eating said very good grub, nothing that was critical would happen.... BUT if they stopped eating, put the ladder truck out of commission and went to help your cat, and a true emergency happened, they'd be caught with their pants down and open to a number of lawsuits that could in fact bankrupt the department/county/city etc. Could the guys have done the job? Sure. Would they do it? probably... but like any other problem in the world, they gotta cover their own ass first. Given the volatile nature and potential implications of working in any of the emergency services (FD, PD, EMS, Hospitals etc etc) I would expect them to act just as you described.

"According to whom? Sounds like ""If it's bad, then that's called capitalism, kids! But if it's magical fairy goodness, that's SOCIALISM! Yay!!!"" > Socialism is common, not state How do you apply ""common"" ownership without an entity that is essentially a state? > ownership of the means of production ""Means of production"" is a meaningless term. Do you mean real property that produces personal property? > as well as democratic control of the means of production by the workers What happens when some workers have a disagreement with other workers about what should be done? Society collapses? Or a state-like entity (let's just call it a state) takes over? > State ownership can technically be socialism if there is also democratic control, but many socialists (especially anarchists) are opposed to state ownership and prefer collective ownership by the people themselves. Since 99% of property is owned by private individuals and corporations, how will this be achieved without violent action on the part of a state-like entity (let's just call it the state)? > If the state both owns and controls the means of production, it's state capitalism, not socialism.",1

"If you start thinking these things through beyond first year economic philosophy frameworks There are a few different private police forces in existencif that's what you want to know. They aren't in developed countries. There is some forces and roles privatised in developed countries for specific policing tasks. That model works because of oversight and transparency. A 100% private police force has significant financial incentives to not be transparent and binding up misbehaviour. It also has financial incentives to misbehave (as do public ones). I.e. drug sales etc. The difference being that a private firm is hard to hold accountable, particularly when there isn't many different police firms to choose from (perfect competition). Then there is also an issue of the funding model and equity. Let's say I'm poor and I get robbed (the statistically most likely to be robbed), I report it, but I can't afford to pay for an investigation/work. Or alternatively, I do, but the person who robbed me has deeper pockets and can pay them to not investigate?

"There's a reason that history tends to judge leaders (like Presidents) very differently than they were judged in their own time. Those who were popular in their time are often judged harshly by history (more harshly than the academics and media of the time who fawned over them judged them), while many (though not all - it's not an iron-clad rule) that were unpopular in their own time are seen by historians as not all that bad, and sometimes doing important things - which generally is why they become unpopular. Indeed, Obama will likely be judged more harshly by history. However, this does not mean that Trump WILL be judged more positively, either - as I say, it's not an iron-clad rule or some weird inverse relationship. :) Here's the thing: You can't usually point to good decisions during the time period they're made, because most really good decisions are long-term ones, which don't have their benefits front loaded. That's kind of the point everyone here is making, isn't it? That the right decisions seem poor or bad at the time, but either are good long-term on their own merits, or the move the needle/conversation to where the big issues are eventually addressed. For example, Trump's canceling DACA seems like a bad idea to progressives short-term, but it will actually force the issue to get addressed. The alternative was really Dreamers being left in limbo - possibly for years - had Trump done nothing and allowed the status quo to continue. There is a similar argument related to the tax cuts, which is seen by the fact Democrats have already changed their tune on it - initially, they said the whole idea was bad, afterwords, and after seeing polling returns and seeing how businesses and the economy are already reacting, they changed to ""well, they aren't big enough/permanent/give too much to big corporations"". just the truth is that our tax system is/was LOOOONG overdue for changes, and still needs more changes, but this is at least a step. Another one which is less what Trump has done and more a result of him being elected: Libertarians have talked for years about the dangers of too much executive power (the dreaded ""Imperial Presidency"" that really came into its prime with Bush and grew with Obama), but neither side really cared. Neocons liked that Bush could make boom-boom on the other side of the world, and Democrats thought that the White House was going to be Blue from now on. No one cared about the power of the Presidency... ...until Trump became President and started with his Executive Orders. Now we have liberal courts supporting the idea of States' Rights! . But, again, the point is that things that are objectively great are very very difficult to really say in the moment, because in the moment, emotions are too charged and ideology is too powerful. We can all look back at, say, Bush Sr raising taxes and say, NOW, nearly 30 years later, that it was a good idea... ...but who, AT THE TIME, would have said or agreed to that? Not many. Indeed, all the things I listed above that have happened under Trump you likely oppose right now, because emotion and ideology. just 20 years from now, you might look at those things and go ""Oh yeah, I could see those things not being all bad."" So no one is going to be able to convince you, right now, that Trump has made or is making good decisions. You either think that already or you don't. It'll be this way for you for a decade or two, just like it will for everyone else.",1

"Again, you have this notion that there is this huge group of support that is a super majority in this country, typical mentality of someone who hasn't really traveled and seen the country. >The underlying presumption is that the State just sort of waved its hands and hundreds of years of structural oppression just sort of vanished...... a notion that grants the State an almost godlike control over the beliefs and actions of everyone. Not what I was saying at all. Racism did not just disappear, you are correct. I think the state already did the only thing it can do by passing the Civil Rights Act. Everything else since then that is government sanctioned to promote diversity is counterproductive, however. Whereas you think the State can be used to solve the issue to some extent, I think the State has absolutely no role. Your examples only go to further my argument. That study that employers discriminate against people with minority-sounding names, exists in a society where the government supposedly promotes diversity. >Race does still matter. In fact, in your other post you don't look at the governance of this country in terms of what people believe politically, religiously, or culturally. You look at solely in racial terms as if ""mostly white"" means that there a uniform portion of the population that is going to vote exactly the same way. Not what I meant, you notice in that post I mention the author should use canonical statistics. The fact is in a country that is 80% white, the majority of any pool of people, regardless of role, is going to be white. I am criticizing the author for stating the obvious as if it is a bad thing. It's statements like that that only serve to further divide the country. >Which cannot be done if the Right fundamentally opposes any effort to combat racism as ""white discrimination"". There is no such thing as ""white discrimination"" or ""reverse discrimination"". Simply put it is discrimination. And some government policies do discriminate against white folks. Those aren't the only policies I am opposed to however. I am opposed to all policy involving race other than the Civil Rights Acts and related Constitutional Amendments. As I said before regardless of the purpose, by making race a factor in order to ""make up"" for past historical events is a fruitless and in this case divisive solution. I maintain the only way to get people to stop looking at color as a factor is to lead by example. The government still promotes racism through its current policies and it is wrong. >There is something ""special"" about them: they are underrepresented... You cannot blame the government for forcing companies to hire minorities for the lack of minorities that are present in companies Actually I can. And I will. It's promoting racism in the establishment, maintaining that somehow race is a factor when it comes to employment. The government is sending the message to employers and the people that ""underrepresented minorities"" are somehow inherently inferior to everyone else and need special treatment in order to be competitive. That's not the intention, but that is the underlying psychological message. >I am a Mexican. Congrats? You want a medal? We all are something. I am Colombian and German. You can't imagine how much crap I got as a kid with that combo. Everyone is something. People are going to be shitheads no matter where you are at. Europe is portrayed as this Nirvana of racial purity, yet they are some of the most racist folks in the planet. Get a little bit of diversity in their countries and things fall apart rapidly.

"As a matter of fact, when it is the worst case scenario and everything has gone to pot in the worst ways imaginable, having that hope to hold fast makes more of a difference than anything else really. I've seen it for the families that must now overcome tragedy, for nursemaid and staff that are devastated by the loss, and for those that are knowingly in the very twilight of their own existence. That faith gives hope, and the hope gives a strength that I can only pity someone to be with out in these types of circumstances. Grace is the result, in tragedy, in joy, it is grace for which I am most thankful. Ha I am a nurse and have done a good amount of OB. If you think the doc and OB nursemaid are not praying right along with the parents when it all heads south, you are fooling yourself.

"Keep trying though, these were better replies than the last set. My point is moot just because you're interpreting it incorrectly. My point is that it's stupid and pointless to argue for zombies to be added to a battle pass that barely affects it in the least. Nothing about that has changed just because they could've done it better. I actually play zombies fairly regularly, I paying for the full game and I make sure to play every mode. I enjoy all 3 and I can still say that adding zombies progression to the current pass is an idiotic thought. The progression system and the way zombies is played wouldn't work together we'll, especially since you'd be spending unenjoyable amounts of time playing zombies to get even one rank. All of the modes in the game are worth 1/3 of the games price to me, the battle pass doesn't affect my idea of worth in any way, shape or form. I didn't pay for the pass, they offered free shit if I played specific modes, that doesn't devalue time spent in zombies, it just means they're focusing on the modes that have the highest population of people. If you truly view the battle pass as something that devalues your time, simply because you can't earn a very small set of cosmetics through it, then the problem lies in your mentality and not the game.

Honestly, I'm not expecting to have much going from my side. This is primarily to allow her to explore her bisexuality. I might have some relationships with friends deepen; but I'm just as happy being monogamous.

Like: 24 Dislike: 5 Can't classify: 7 Even in that quick and dirty count, there were far more people liking it than disliking it.

That said, I would need a good argument for why the initial reviews were wrong. I'd need evidence. I'd need logical support. Simply saying that reviews aren't 100% accurate does not justify taking a converse position. >There are plenty of mainstream games that are nothing more than recycled garbage yet they constantly get 10/10s. Evidence lacking. Also irrelevant, since we're not talking about ""plenty of mainstream games,"" but Octopath Traveler. >When I said the game was mediocre, I wasnt talking about the score, the score is irrelevant. The game itself is mediocre Right, and I called that an exaggeration and appealed to several sources of evidence. None of my sources are definitive; I agree that reviews, that user ratings, that thread comments aren't 100% reliable. That said, they are somewhat reliable; they provide a counterargument that you need to build a case against if you want more people to agree with you.

"While some may outgrow it and break out of it like I did, This poped up on the front page for me, so I dont post here often, but I don't see how it's wrong. As a liberal, I notice conservatives always argue from authority. It's always ""what the founding fathers wanted"" or ""the constitution"" (and even then, not the actual constitution, but their idealized version in which many provisions and interpretations in it don't exist), or ""God said"" or ""according to the Bible"". When your entire political perspective is essentially based on a giant mess of line from authority, it's not surprising when people get that impression of you. I know not all conservatives are like this, particularly the more socially liberal fiscal conservatives, but it really appears to me that conservative ideology is deeply rooted in tradition, religion, and their distorted views of the good old days. I don't think they need the guidance of a cop or drill sergeant (although some appear that way), but they definitely do seem to be clueless about morality once you reject their bases of it in the constitution and religion. Which is why so many conservative christians think atheists are totally amoral sociopaths, and why so many conservatives in politics think anything that isn't in line with what the founding fathers wanted is bad. I think it's possible to grow out of such mindsets, and therefore think that the naturally submissive part is slightly inaccurate, as an ex conservative it's more of a lifelong conditioning thing.",1

"How is it after all this time you've insulted me, I'm the one feeling bad for you? >No, someone need not be shot. The point you should take from Chekov's gun is that every part of the story need be essential. Nobody needs to be shot to make the gun important, as by virtue of hanging in the wall, it already functions as characterization. A person who hangs a gun, is very different from a person who does not. You gain hints on a person's personality this way in a very elegant, subtle way. A man with guns, who never uses them, is a completely valid story to tell. Saying that it must go off is exaggeration. People like you, who take things too literally, are abusing it, and are writing predictable, terrible stories. When they say, ""there's a gun on the wall,"" there is no predicate for what kind of person is hanging a gun on the wall or how they are hanging it. It could be for practical reasons or for ornamentary reasons. The important thing is not your overly-pedantic breakdown of the terminus itself, the point is that the gun is there, and it should go off if it's there. And you agree with me that, ""every part of the story need be essential,"" which is exactly what I meant when I said, ""Extraneous story elements need to be curbed."" Now you're just disagreeing with me for its own sake. >Her goal was escape. There is no requirement that she do so individually. It's almost like people make their decisions with the most recent information. Your arguments are handled with the grace of an alcoholic jugger. You know, if you're going to insult me, it doesn't endear me to you or anyone who will see this for you to steal my digs like Xoh steals from Geoff's scripts. And for the record, the phrase, ""This won't stop me, Kirito, no way! I'll never give up! I''ll find a way to get out of here..."" directly implies that she is actively intending to independently escape through her own means. Not that she's just going to start suddenly acting passive at the drop of a hat. >You fail to make even the most basic observations, are confused by the simplest things, and are incapable of self-reflection, as evidenced by your constant hypocrisy. Your points are also exceptionally dumb. Some dumb, DUMB shit. Nothing personal, though. That means I can pretend to give you advice on how to win people over and be likable even if I am nothing of the sort. Look guy, considering the fact that you've been calling me an idiot this whole argument, the fact that you're now stealing the exact format of what I said to say that what I'm saying is dumb shit does not surprise, offend, or really bother me in the least. Your claims of me being unable to make basic observations and so forth are just baseless pejoratives that you're throwing out not for any other reason than to try and rub me the wrong way. >There was a declaration of will. There was no plan. She was caught before, and now knows that the same thing will no longer work. She is waiting, with no reason to, for a change of develpment she can neither expect or plan for. Being able to escape on her own relies on far more uncertain elements than just passing it to Kirito. You also don't know what a red herring is. Look it up, and try again. Maybe you mean a strawman, ad-hom, or a false equivalence. All things you have done. And it does not matter what you claim to be. You, and mother's basement, have shown that you possess feminist sensibilities. First off, she was obviously going to plan ahead if she meant to escape after the matter. If she didn't, then she's even more stupid then I thought. Second, yes, that is exactly what a red herring is. ( http It is something that misleads or misdirects from an important issue. I.E. you bringing up this feminism bullshit that doesn't matter to the argument. >Oh, my god. You don't even understand Kirito. I mean, was that not the point? His solo playing supposedly being a character flaw that needed to be resolved, which Asuna helped him get over? A flaw that was caused by prior trauma with the MBC? Like, even as someone who doesn't like the show, this is basic shit. >First, what she did was completely logical. Second, sane people do illogical things all the time. It does not mean they are mentally unstable. It's like you have no idea how other people operate in the world. Are you truly trapped in your mother's basement? Another mother's basement joke. ( http Anyway, yes, sane people do illogical things all the time, but they usually don't do suicidally stupid things or things that go against their personality. >Jesus. A conscious person isn't in a coma. A person able to communicate is not a in coma. THE CAPTIVE'S KNOWLEDGE tells her that Yui fully capable of communicating because she recieved a call. She is completely incompatible with a coma patient. You realize that in my thought experiment, I explicitly stated that the captive heard their child's voice as a point of comparison? >Actually, last she knows Yui is active. She called her. How are you still going on with this bullshit? I'm talking about the prior conditions to their captivity, which are analogous as can be. >This is a strawman, or a red herring, or whatever bullshit terminology you use. She has the information that Yui is active because Yui actively communicated with her. All the information she needs is accessible to her. Do you not understand how new information invalidates past belief? Do you not understand asuna's frame of mind, when in a desperate situation, she receives proof that Yui is active? I wasn't even saying that the part about her hearing the voice itself was the real breaking point. This is just another bullshit red herring about a point I wasn't really arguing that much in the first place. I brought it up, sure, I've never really stated that Yui not being active was a particularly strong reason for the logical incoherency of the scene. It, like Kirito being with Yui, is simply another logical jump that's less egregious than the others, but simply compounds on top of the other, far more unacceptable ones. >Feel free to repeat your flawed arguments that I have responded to again and again, or accuse me of something you yourself will commit a few seconds later.

"The meaning of life must necessarily be something within life itself, not something external. > For if we amount into nothing, we go into nothing as well. If we amount from God then we can go into God. This doesn't follow, here. >I am going for a degree in philosophy so I hope it is well informed I have one, and I've done graduate work, too. Let's see if I can help: In order for life to have intrinsic meaning, that meaning must be found within the thing in and of itself. Life, itself, then, must contain its own meaning. Otherwise, it's not the ""meaning of life"" but the meaning of whatever the thing really is. So, if the meaning of life is God, then God cannot possibly be the meaning of life at all; God would be the meaning of God, and God alone. God is not intrinsic to life. In fact, if you're a believer of the bible, God existed before creation, so God is not intrinsic to anything. God precedes everything. I will say again at the risk of repeating myself.",1

This is a direct infringement on my freedom of speech, is it not? There are two subtly different, but connected parts to this and I'm not sure, which one you are asking. One is the ""I don't want to offend someone, so I don't say what I'm thinking"" part. That clearly doesn't violate any of your rights, because it's fundamentally your choice. You are free to say what you want, you just don't. The other is the ""I am forbidden to say things that I want to say"" part. And that also doesn't violate your rights, because xkcd.

I also like how you wholly ignore defensive gun use. >Wow. Absolutely everything can contribute to lowering gun violence. Except gun control. Because reasons. /s It's more that, there are more factors at work in violence and we have PROVEN CAUSALITY for some factors while guns->violent crimes isn't even correlated, much less proven - so why the fuck are you wasting political capital and effort targeting the method, which IS NOT A CONFIRMED CAUSAL FACTOR instead of the proven causes of these crimes? If you ban some of the guns (because a total ban is explicitly unconstitutional and will not pass unless you manage to repeal the Second Amendment first), you MIGHT see a reduction in total violent crimes. Emphasis on might. You will probably see a reduction in gun crimes, but that DOES NOT mean that will translate to a reduction in total violent crimes and there is very short solid data to support such a claim. On the other hand, if you introduce legislation to target ANY of those non-gun factors I mentioned above, you WILL see a reduction in total violent crime rates - WHICH INCLUDES GUN CRIMES - because they are a causal factor in violent crime rates. Political capital and willpower is not infinite in a democracy. You cannot both ban the guns and tackle our fucked up private prison system and implement universal healthcare in whatever form and tackle income inequality and begin taking steps to end the war on drugs and make our public schools less shit and beat seven kinds of hell out of predatory student loan lenders so that people can actually afford to pursue post-secondary education without turning themselves into wage slaves for 20 years thereafter.

"they can start working together with their man and improve their situation Men are under represented in the hair and nail care field, that doesn't count though right? Promotions are directly related to a few things. Work ethic, quality of work, reliability, and hours. Women do not fall short in any of the above aside from hours. If joe and Jane both started working for you and both are excellent employees what would you say the deciding factor will be when you decide to promote one (let's say you take on 2 new employees) to manage the other employees? Joe and Jane both have families. In order to provide for his family joe works 60 hours a week. Jane has to go home after 8 hours because her family needs her (at least she feels that way). You're going to promote the employee who logs the most hours because most employers equate hours with productivity. This isn't necessarily true but that's how it is. I don't know why I'm being down voted, I hypothesis the femenazis don't like being told their argument is invalid.

Ask other people, many folks have family, schoolmates, coworkers, or other acquaintances. Ask people you don't know very well, ask people who you're sure will say no, some may surprise you. Hell, ask strangers you run into if you are comfortable with it. Game stores are a thing. Easier with a car, but barring that there's public transportation like busses/trains, personal transportation like bicycles, and your two best locomotive friends, left foot and right foot. Plenty game stores run Adventurer's League, if public play is your thing, and you can always try to recruit players you meet into a private game. Even if AL doesn't fit your schedule, just showing up and talking to employees and patrons goes a long way. Along with game stores, the idea of flyers comes to mind. One of the earliest ways people historically found groups was to advertise, with a little flyer ""Hey I want to do this DnD thing and need people to play with, this is what I want, this is my schedule, call me here"" with phone number rip-off bits at the bottom. Put them up in game stores, or really anywhere else that has cork boards. And all of that hasn't even delved into the internet. Places like /r/lfg can be used to find in person games. And you can find people to play online with using Roll20 or FantasyGrounds or the archaic but ever classic message board or chat client. I'm not saying it's easy. All of these things come with hurdles to overcome, especially for people who are introverted or experience mental illness (anxiety in particular) on a significant scale. Not every solution works for every person either, it's much tougher if you're in a particularly rural place, or have no viable transportation, or don't have internet.

"Also, your comment that ""In every video from an analytical youtuber there always a guy going that it's ""basic"" or ""stating the obvious"" is just plain ignorant. Honestly, I've never seen any of what you claim to be the standard when it comes to an individual commenting that something is ""basic"" or whatever. Yeah, late, blah blah; whatever. While I get what your issue is, in this instance Digibro simply didn't put in any effort towards this video or his critique. Besides, just saying ""lol, nothing new was added by the comment"" beleaguers the point. You say videos of varying length are all ""redundant"" to some extent, and - in certain aspects - that's not very wrong.] Where the fault with your comment lies is that there are videos out there that aren't redundant or bring to light new aspects that - while of course they become obvious after you've seen them - most people simply wouldn't have thought of. Supereyepatchwolf, for one, is a great anituber in this regard. Bestguyever is also one of the best in bringing to light aspects of anime or issues that no one else ever brings up. Cartoon Cypher is another fantastic one. You just have to branch out to the minor leagues instead of solely relying on the big names, as of course those names are going to simply repeat the same shit over and over again. While other anitubers like The Anime Man, Mother's Basement, or Glass Reflection have their niches and also can be redundant, the worst offender of all of this is Digibro for a few fairly simple reasons: Digibro is jaded and cynical. He's not an analytical anituber - he's a reactionary. Everything that he puts out is stamped with his stereotypical angst and because of that he, more often than not, doesn't ever add anything new to the conversation. It's actually one of the biggest reasons I can't stand his videos; he has almost no positive commentary and instead jumps to conclusions without giving thought beyond what he sees (which usually means he never gets past the first episode, or maybe the third). He's become so nihilistic regarding anime, that everything he says is just that: crude and worthless. For chrissakes, he did those entire 20 some odd ""Why The Asterisk War Sucks"" videos without actually understanding what he's talking about. Granted, while I'm not a huge fan of The Asterisk War, the mere fact he went that in depth as to why he hates it is beyond enough to understand his motivations - not to mention his ridiculous ""How To Tell An Anime Sucks From One Episode"" video. That's just the kind of person he is: angry, jaded and has the desire to spread that hate to everyone so they can also hate the things he hates. Go through his videos and look to see what he actually likes. There's literally maybe five videos talking about something he enjoyed, and his KonoSuba video is about as close to a positive perspective as you're going to get from him. You say it's to present the ideas in a simple and interesting way. In the case of Digibro, that's simply not the case. He's not providing any interesting content, he's simply being redundant about the same issues he's had from the very beginning. If people find that to be enlightening, so be it. But, in my opinion, his commentary is about as far away from legitimate critique and being interesting than any other anituber. And that's saying a lot. Digibro is just not someone you want to have dictate new ideas and positions, because 9 times out of 10 those positions are ""This sucks and if you like it, you suck"". That very attitude has become systemic and is influencing a great many anime fans as he happens to be one of the most popular, if not the most popular commentator. To say that he's providing a novel approach and that's ultimately the point of watching his shows is just a great disservice to the anime fandom on the whole. He simply is not one to take seriously, and I believe he'd agree with me on that. EDIT: I should also point out that Digibro is banned from /r/anime for a reason. None of the other anitubers are, so ask yourself: why Digibro? It's definitely not just because he kept propping up his own videos. There was more to it than that, and a lot of it had to do with his attitude. EDIT 2:",1

That's ludicrous imagine if Africa demanded Europe stop their exploding population in the 1800s because ""they need to stop emigrating and taking over the world"" African share of population greatly exceeds whatever historical they ever reached, so I don´t understand this argument, the European growth in the 19th century is already on a smaller scale than this one. >Hence why I said most, which is true.

"Op said no woman would want to carry because it is uncomfortable, I said that was wrong. I'm sorry but I'm having a hard time finding your point in all of that. The original statement was that there are no women that are active and carry because it is just too uncomfortable. In response I have asserted that that is wholly incorrect, as someone with extensive experience with guns and the community I know of countless women that work highly active jobs that carry quite comfortably. I don't understand how your mother not carrying at her job with kids means other people can't do so comfortably. >If she wore her holster around children, she'd spend all day trying to keep her bra from being ripped off by curious kids trying to find out what she's got, because hey, it could be candy!! That has to be the dumbest thing I have ever heard. She can't carry because a kid might see it and think its candy? The 'Flash Bang' type holster goes on the underside of the bra and rides center line at the bottom of the rib cage. You can't see it and a kid would have to get their hand all the way up or down your blouse to access the gun. No, that is a weak and stupid reason. >There are also other times when it is impractical for her to wear a holster. Okay? Totally irrelevant. We're talking about teachers carrying at work, you wearing many formal gowns to first grade? Not being able to carry in a full length gown is a stupid and entirely narrow situation that plenty of women have managed to figure out in the past. >While you are correct in stating that there are loads of concealed carry options for women that countless females rely on every single day without issue, it is your idea that those options are a hardheaded and functional option for every woman, of every body type, in any situation is an incorrect, blatantly ignorant blanket statement that is not based in fact.

Back up a bit and take a deep breath. You are taking it too personally. Once you have made up your mind to be an atheist then the religious are no longer part of your prerogative. Just be you. It is not necessary for you to be judging or rating anyone else. You certainly wouldn't want to be judged by a group of religious zealots would you? Don't worry your self with intellectual pygmies. After all no one elect atheist to be the guardians of intellect did they? I sincerely doubt creationism is the preeminent problem in America today.

"Is there some shame if one isn't on the side of airtight ""real truth""? Hopefully not, as ""real truth"" doesn't exist as far as the best and brightest of our species can tell. I'll try to summarize your main issues: 1. The use of two terms which are likely worldviews of many r/atheists. Not sure why you're still so caught up on these, as they're simply frameworks from which to understand what it is possible to know and how we arrive at such knowledge which leave no room for a deity. 2. You still seem resolved to defend the position that the scientific method is completely separate from philosophy. 3. Atheists don't require a belief in any sort of metaphysics. Responses: 1. I'm not going to type out summaries again. Positivism. Naive Empiricism. 2. Philosophy is involved both the formulation of the scientific method itself and the interpretation of data. Empirical data alone is useless, it must be analyzed within some framework (the method) and interpreted in order to be of any use. The method itself cannot be designed by science. Philosophers are behind the details of the scientific method. If you choose to deny this, please give your explanation of how we arrived at the method. This is essentially the same question which you dodged earlier, i.e. name a scientific result which is separate from all philosophy. The interpretation of results is crucial to science itself. For any set of physical data there is literally an infinite number of mathematical models which will fit the data to any desired precision. The very idea of an ""electron"" is an interpretation. This concept is useful for asking further questions, but it is an abstraction from the data. If we wanted to, we could still use the epicyclic, geocentric model of the solar system to describe retrograde motion. There is no predictive difference between Kepler's heliocentric, elliptical model of the solar system and a sufficiently tuned version Ptolemy's geocentric model. If we work out the details of the epicycles and such with enough precision, the model can be used for identical predictions to that of Kepler and Newton. So why do we choose the heliocentric model? Occam's razor is philosophical in nature. Beyond the fact that data is useless without some interpretation, in many cases the interpretation suggests new models or experiments. Einstein was convinced that some sort of deterministic hidden variables were behind the randomness of quantum mechanics. A guy by the name of John Bell devised some experiments to test whether or not hidden variables were even possible. This is some pretty far out science, and at this point, philosophical interpretation is pretty much the only guide for forming new hypotheses. General Relativity was inspired by Mach's principle. It makes statements about equivalences of differing states which are central to physics, but at the time were nowhere to be found within theory or data. If you're still somehow convinced that science be in a vacuum, I can't help you. 3. <---(this is a 3, I do not understand reddit's formatting) I never said that atheists need to believe in a metaphysics. One member of the Vienna circle wrote a paper entitled ""The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language"", part of the reason I mentioned the circle. That said, atheists do have to maintain some sort of worldview (unless one is a nihilist), which is the reason I provided two example frameworks. Not as authoritative statements, but to illustrate that pretty much every worldview is a positive assertion of the manner in which things work. There are plenty of worldviews out there that do not leave room for a deity or religion or a whole host of other things. Unless you're a nihilist, though, there is some form of the world which you prefer to believe in. I say ""believe in"", as up to this point in science/philosophy/humanity there is no way of telling which view is correct (or even if a correct view exists). The only question I have for you is this: Why are you so steadfastly holding to the positions that atheism isn't a belief and that science is separate from philosophy? As to the former question, I have no idea why so many atheists get so touchy when their system is labeled a 'belief'.",1

I have to guess that you’re not a fan of poetry or literary devices at all then? That everything must be cut and dry? What’s the point?

So if you want to claim that all along you've really been trying to say ""hey, maybe there was a before, I certainly have no opinion about it either way"", then I don't know what you meant by criticizing hawking for ""assuming"" that there was a before. I didn't say it doesn't, I said it assumes that it does. I don't know if it does, and nothing you've said has indicated that it does. But you're right, my initial response to the quote was poor, I think I misread it. >wtf? >Here's where you said you understood that there was no before: http Absolutely, the way I understand time is that it emerged during the big bang, and thus I'm not sure referencing ""before"" that event makes sense. Not saying it doesn't, not claiming it doesn't, I'm unsure. This is a statement of ignorance, intended to caution against making claims and conclusions while we (humanity) is so ignorant. If you took this as a positive degree claim, that's on you. >Ironically, my reference to you saying ""there was some other kind of time"" was about you making a straw man out of my argument. I never said there was some other kind of time, but YOU said that phrase, and pretended that I did, and then ridiculed it. That's literally the textbook way to make a straw man. Hypocrite, much? Lol this is shaky at best. I wasn't trying to suggest you were saying there is another kind of time, nor mocking you for it. I'm mocking you for ""countering"" me expressing ignorance by waxing philosophical and then saying ""there's no reason to think there wasn't time!"" I'm concerned you've misread everything I've been saying, which would explain your weird anger. >When you said ""from what I understand, before the big bang is not a thing"". In fact, your understanding is overstated. Well, since that isn't what I said.... And I'm more than happy to continue to admit my understanding is flawed, I'm not sure what your point is. How again does speculating without evidence of any kind ""counter"" my admission of ignorance? >When you say ""so I'm not sure that [...]"", it kind of sounds like you're just trying to be polite when correcting someone. It doesn't necessarily come across as ""I have no idea, here's one possibility, but it's just as likely as any other"", like you're now claiming you meant. I didn't mean that, I meant "" here's what I understand ( with an implicit meaning that science understands it as such) that time began during the big bang, and expressed doubt that ""before the big bang"" makes sense as a comment.

"This isn't really up for debate. This is how it works. If you don't have an intuitive understanding of the math of this, I'm sorry ace won't be able to spend any more of my time explaining it to you. Pulgar was a huge outlier so far, there's no doubt. But there's nothing inherent about being a woman that prevents them from being raised as great chess players except they're not exposed to it as often as men, and when they are, they're not as encouraged to become great, and when they are, they're not as encouraged to tenaciously pursue it. No doubt, countless Pulgars have probably come and gone without ever playing the game. For that reason ace say society are the ones that need to catch up. I'll leave it at that. As to the Elo question, you're simply not understanding the concept, which is kind of funny because it's the part of what ace said that helps your original argument. You use the rating range of ""1400-1700"" for your example. This shows right there an inherent lack of understanding of the concept to begin with. For one, there's nothing inherently true about Elo rating where you can say ""let's say their true rating is X"". It's only a rating relative to the pool it's played in. So to say ""let's assume they're rated 1400-1700"" is an unreasonable assumption. For one it gives credence to the idea that there's some sort universally true rating that you can assign to each player, which there isn't. Secondly, why would the range be so tight? In reality, they'd have terrible players in this pool as well. So if you were to give them each a FIDE rating equivalent, a more fair assumption would be something like 600-2600. On an island where there's no 2700 fide players, we'd get one of them reaching 2700 anyways. It doesn't matter what their fide rating would be, the cream would still rise to the top.",1

After searching up Dr. Sanjay Gupta and advanced quantum hydroponics (hydroponics has nothing to do with quantum studies, hydroponics is a way of growing food very efficiently) I found that the original article talking about this theory was made by The Onion, a well known PARODY NEWS WEBSITE! ( link: http ) 2. This shows no evidence and is purely speculative, it doesn't even actually touch on the subject you say it does! The author also has shown no qualifications. 3.

"finally construct an argument, I'd be happy to have an actual debate with you. That's not making anything up, that's me speaking(albeit a little subjectively if you really want to take technical) of how the nature of battle threads are. Next. Once again, this example that you're giving is still not showing me making anything up. But I will reply to it and explain my reasoning behind the whole ""x>y"" argument. Certain characters can have glaring weaknesses and can lose certain battles for a multitude of reasons. These reasons can make a huge difference in the context of a battle. For example, Kakashi beat Obito, right? Now, does this mean that Kakashi would also beat Guy, Naruto, and Killer Bee combined? No, most likely not. But since Kakashi beat Obito(context is apparently irrelevant here), he should be able to do the same thing that Obito did, right? That's exactly where the problem lies in those kinds of lists. I figure, if a character is so absolutely better than another in you eyes, then why not just argue about it using feats and evidence? If you're so sure Madara would win, why haven't you made a solid argument yet? DMS Kakashi feats are similarly applicable to Obito, considering that Obito was the reason why Kakashi was able to use the DMS. Everything I argue for DMS Obito, I can support with manga feats and I can in fact thoroughly explain why it's applicable if you so wish, just call me out on whatever it is that you doubt. Now, compare this, to the fact that you have no argument whatsoever concerning Madara. Just as you said I'm guessing, you're guessing right here. The truth is, we can't be certain. But tell me why Kamui wouldn't work? Kamui allows the user to phase through objects as shown various times in the manga, why is Amaterasu an exception. If you can explain why it wouldn't work, then I'll concede this argument, but until then, you have nothing. Obito doesn't have to be better than Madara at tai, nin, or genjutsu. He only needs Kamui to win, and you still haven't proven that wrong. But even so, Obito is on par with Madara in terms of ninjutsu. I can explain why if you so wish. First off, Madara can't speed blitz him. A half dead Obito that was being controlled by Black Zetsu was able to block two TSBs, Madara is at most on par with the speed of a TSB or perhaps even slower. As a matter of fact, Obito was faster than Madara in that same chapter as well. Remember when Madara tried to take out his Rinnegan? Obito activated Kamui before he could grab it. Madara cannot speed blitz Obito. And you also seem to keep misunderstanding, Obito is going use Kamui on Madara to kill him. Obito has both eyes, meaning all he has to do is look at Madara for less than a second and the fight's over. downgraded shinobi skills don't matter in this fight, I don't know why you're brining them up. We're arguing Madara vs DMS Obito. Nothing else, don't bring up any other hypothetical situations for the fight other than that. Like I said, if you want to debate Hashirama vs. Obito, go make a post about it and send me the link. I will not speak further on this subject here in this thread. Now, if you would kindly",1

"You claim that you understand the meaning of the saying, but the rest of your entire comment, and your previous comment shows that you are still misinterpreting it. Do you have to ask the McDonald's employee how much an ice cream cone costs to decide whether or not to buy it? Do you compare the price of different gums to decide which gum to buy? You can make the assumption that it's priced low enough that people will buy it, so you look for what you want without really considering price too much. You don't need to ask the price because you are certain you can afford it, and it's the flavor you want, even if the gum you want is 2-3x the price of the other gums available. If the price of an ice cream cone or gum is a significant factor in deciding whether or not you will buy it, you are probably better off just not buying it. You are seriously overestimating how much $40k is to a big business. I see 2-3 million if dollars worth of product move through my department at work every day, $40k is barely a blip on the radar. We're not even the biggest department in the building, there's $15-20 million dollars worth of product that leaves our factory every day. If the company I work for were to buy a 3D printer they would look for the printer that best fits their needs and as long as it isn't drastically overpriced (which is extremely rare because the other company needs to sell the a bunch of that product to stay afloat, so it is almost guaranteed to be reasonably priced) that would be the one they would buy. Price is only one factor when buying something, it's importance varies drastically for each purchase. For things that are going to be purchase in very large quantities (a component that goes into a product) the price is really important because a 1 cent price difference means several million dollars per year. But for something like a big ass 3D printer that's likely going last several years and pay for itself in that time, cost is a much smaller part of the equation. Things like features, quality, reliability, serviceability matter a lot more.",1

"I suspect that at this point in my comment you've realised that there's no possible way you can continue defending the position you initially took and you'll either attempt some ""TLDR"" cop-out, or you'll respond semi-ironically like you did with your last line of your previous comment, which reads.. >He works for Breitbart, the ""platform of the alt-right. Do they proclaim themselves to be ""the platform of the alt-right""? Or did you just hear someone else say that about them? >He writes alt-right articles: He wrote an article about the alt-right. The WSJ did as well. The NYT did as well. Still waiting for a quote or article where he claims to represent them. >The cameraman is employed by Breitbart. So yeah, that's a ""sign if political support"". No it's not, actually. Richard Lewis used to WRITE for Breitbart and wasn't even a fervent right winger, let alone part of ""the alt-right"", let alone a racist nationalist nazi or whatever you think these people are. This is a CAMERAMAN. He doesn't even need to have political opinions. His answer to every political question could be him drooling all over himself. You don't need to be politically affiliated with whatever platform you're working for, especially if your work has nothing to do with expressing your beliefs. >If they're simply open minded and curious, they'd know what they were walk to into. Milo is characteristically offensive, and goes out if his way to sell shock value. Yes, he's a bit edgy. What's your point here? That because he's known to say offensive things, everyone who's aware of that wouldn't go see a talk of his because that's too much for them to handle? I mean, what? I disagree with Milo on nearly every point of political policy because I'm left-leaning, especially on social issues. Yet I could see myself going to see a talk of his, especially if someone I knew was also attending. Curious how that immediately refutes the implied sentiment that at every Milo talk, the room must be filled with people who think exactly like him. >Just as I'm sure you don't care that Breitbart spreads hateful conspiracy theories that lead people to shoot up pizza parlors. What an incredibly stupid assumption. Why would you think I don't care about that? Even if I were on Breitbarts side of the discussion - and I am absolutely not - I could easily distance myself from that without losing credibility, just like every SJW-type person can rightly distance themselves from the BLM supporter who shot at police officers in Dallas, while still supporting BLM. Let me clarify once more though (because I have a feeling you'll misinterpret even the most tepid defense as an endorsement) that I am more aligned with [insert most left-wing outlet on earth] than I am with Breitbart. It's exactly for that reason that I dislike bad criticism of it, because it makes people like me look stupid. No idea what you were going for with that line, but it misfired horribly >...Milo works for Breitbart. Breitbart is the alt-right. Already given you an example of someone who worked for Breitbart who doesn't even identify as a right winger so... lol. >Go to the alt-right subreddit. They say it's a race movement in the sidebar. You're making a lot of logical leaps here. I'll spell some out that don't follow: 1. Breitbart ""is"" the alt right, even though they've only been labeled that by outside news sources like CNN. If you look on Wikipedia it says alt-right people typically use websites like ""Breitbart and Twitter"". Although that's undoubtedly true, does that make Twitter an alt-right platform too? What if they personally don't agree with that categorization? How are you going to still tell me they must agree with the sidebar of some subreddit that labels themselves the same thing? 2. Everyone who does identify as being an alt-righter must agree with the definition presented by a subsection of volunteer moderators on reddit.com who consider themselves part of the alt-right. Meanwhile, some people have been told they're part of the ""alt-right"" just because they like Trump more than Hillary and have no idea what reddit even is. 3. Everyone who is part of a ""race movement"" or even has false racial biases is the kind of evil racist who should be ""afraid"" (that's how this conversation initially started). I agree, people who affiliate themselves with the white power movement, stormfronters, people who unironically say ""14/88"", people who go fight antifa protestors, and everyone in that fringe should be fucking afraid whenever they leave their house. But if you think someone should be ""afraid"" because they're uncomfortable in the presence of black people (DISCLAIMER: yes, this is obviously a harmful and racist thought) even though there's not a malicious bone in their body, then you're a bad person. Note also that this isn't a concession that right wingers who like Milo are all ""racists"". If you talk to any social justice activist worth their salt they will tell you that every single person including themselves has implicit racial biases. These can't really be ""avoided"" when you live in a society that is allegedly racist. Thus the moral high horse of the people like you who try to label others ""racist"" is in jeopardy. It's not enough to demonstrate that someone prefers spending time with someone of their own race 0.001% more than they do spending time with someone of another race. This is everyone, ostensibly, including SJWs themselves, and including you. In order to demonize someone for being a ""racist"" to the extent where they should be ""afraid"", they have to hold malicious, hateful beliefs in one form or another, and you haven't even come CLOSE to demonstrating that you can so comfortably assume that everyone at a Milo talk is this type of racist, that you might as well be able to assault them on the spot.",1

"Did you cum yet? Again: philosophy grad student, top of class, full scholarship. All I read here is empty rhetoric, pure bullshit and projection. I master the underlying issues and have to break them down for your dumb ass. >You keep presenting faulty analogies. You claim that it is faulty without anything to back it up. Rights are cultural institutions, like marriages and money. >What I asked was, if we grant that a right had been proved, what would be the consequence? This question is nonsensical. Rights aren't theorems. They aren't proved. They are declared, recognized, granted, asserted, etc. >No, I asserted that, applying the standards you set (i.e., ""we can make anything a right""), we would logically deduce that nothing is a right. And it does not follow. Just like 'we can marry any two people, therefore no one is married' or 'we can make anything currency (paper, coins, bitcoins), therefore nothing is currency.' Please actually do logically deduce it, and I'll concede the point. Until then it's empty rhetoric to say that you could do it. I'll repeat myself: no matter how much you need to misread me, I don't endorse moral relativism. >By asserting that ""we can make anything a right,"" you denied both the absolute existence of rights and the objective existence of rights. No, for the same reason that married people and currency exist objectively. Unless you have a weird definition of what exists. >Again, neither moral realism nor consequentialism would permit that ""we can make anything a right."" A consequentialist, say an utilitarian, could, to make it simple, just say that the only moral fact is that one should maximize utility, while still holding that rights (like currency and marriages) are human institutions, albeit ones that tend to maximize utility in most (but not all) circumstances. That is a perfectly coherent stance. >If moral facts exist, then it cannot possibly be true that ""we can make anything a right."" Give a non question-begging reason why. Before you try, get this through your thick head: rights and moral facts are not mutually entailing concepts. If you think they are mutually entailing, that is a substantive thesis, not a conceptual one, thus you have to argue for it. >The existence of moral facts is, however, the very basis of natural rights theory. Sure, but natural rights theory is far from being entailed by moral realism, which I fucking endorse. >You expressly claimed that ""we can make anything a right."" This is the very essence of relativism. You shoud produce an argument for this claim instead of merely repeating it. >>No. That doesn't follow. All it would show is that natural selection has resulted in certain individuals expressing approval or disapproval of certain behavior. You can't jump from this to a metaphysical thesis. >Not only does it follow--it's the same statement reiterated. A general biological predisposition to approve and disapprove of certain behavior is an innate moral impulse. Nope, and I'm not surprised you don't see the distinction. Approval and disapproval are public, observable behavior. A moral impulse is an unobservable, para-mechanical explanation of that behavior. There is no reason to jump from one to the other, which is my point. Also, I didn't say individuals were pre-disposed, but that the behavior would be the result of natural selection. Different claims. Anyway I reject the premise which states that approval and disapproval, which are learned social practices, are biologically determined. >If you would really like to know, then I suggest you do some research on this topic. The relation between our chemical and biological matter and our moral impulses is a pretty ""hot"" issue at the moment, across several academic disciplines. However, it's usually the extent and nature of this relationship that I've seen debated, rather than the existence of the relationship, which is so self-evident that it seems presumed. By the way, philosophically, this fits under the banner of materialism. Maybe you skipped that wikipedia article? Empty rhetoric. Stop bullshitting. Things that are so self-evident as to be presumed are called prejudice or dogma. But far from being self-evident, the idea that normativity reduces to biology is highly contested. I'm a philosophy grad student, I don't need wikipedia, and materialism is utterly irrelevant to this discussion. >Anyway, some simple observational evidence is insufficient to assert metaphysical theses like moral realism. Are you even trying? >of a material basis for morality includes (i) the cross-cultural commonality of various moral precepts Cool. 'All cultures agree that X is wrong, therefore X is wrong as a matter of fact' is a non-sequitur. Ad populum. Also has nothing to do with a 'material basis.' >and (ii) brain pathology exhibited in many who commit ""immoral"" acts, as compared to brains of morally ""normal"" people. This is so weak. The scare quotes just show how weak even you believe it is. Is correlation causation now? What about immoral behavior of people with healthy brains? Couldn't this also be explained by the fact that we have a tendency to marginalize (i.e. express disapproval of) people with certain pathologies? And again, this is nothing to show the existence of moral facts, because that would require that expressions of approval or disapproval be correct or incorrect, have truth-value. This is something which no amount of biology could ever prove. >But we do not need to locate a ""moral gene"" to determine that there is a genetic (i.e., bio-chemical and heritable) basis for morality. Genetic doesn't mean 'bio-chemical and heritable', it means 'pertaining to genes'.

"You can already obviously see why I did what I did. I've been waiting for so long to tell this story. So I'm a server at Red Robin and I once served a teenage couple probably around 17 or 18 (easily seniors in high school). They had obviously been dating for a while since they already knew what they wanted and ordered for each other. The ""date night"" seemed to go pretty well; they ordered their drinks, ordered an appetizer, then ordered their food. Only their drinks had come out yet when finally after holding hands for a long while the guy looks into the girl's eyes and apparently broke up with her. I had been remain firm from a distance keeping an eye on my tables when suddenly I see this happening and watch the girl's face just turn from happiness to just absolute horror. Tears well up and she started banging her fists on the table screaming out at him that he's an asshole and what not. Everyone in the restaurant can hear it and everything just stops. As she's becoming more and more volatile, he's trying to calm her down. I'm not sure what to do at this point. Even my manager had come out and looked at me as if we both didn't know how to handle this. Finally, the guy yells, ""FINE. FINE. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO BE CIVIL THEN I'LL GO."" She begs him to stay, but he pries himself away and beelines for the door. She doesn't follow him. He passes me on the way to the door, stops, and walks back towards me.

"Maybe consider the possibility you could be mistaken about this and read the post with that in mind. >Sure, some philosophers don't. But, get this, philosophers who don't have problems with basic concepts actually do accept that definition. I responded to your claim that - ""The definition for atheism as is used by philosophers is pretty much the same as ""we"" do over here."" This is a debate, just as you shouldn't be expected to accept my opinion without supporting evidence, I shouldn't be expected to accept your assertion that philosophers use the lacking belief definition without some evidence to support it. And the evidence you supplied in your last post - a link to an IEP article - rather than supporting your claim, shows you're wrong about this. To quote from the article - >""It has come to be widely accepted that to be an atheist is to affirm the non-existence of God."" They specifically say ""it has come to be widely accepted"". The IEP does then mention the lacking belief as minus atheism, but only to specifically distinguish it from the positive atheism definition they will use. Here is the definition they use - >Atheism is the view that there is no God. So philosophers don't use the same definition we use here. >Those are what appear to be the reasoning [ignoring what they don't want to hear, or scaring people into submission] It may appear that way to you, but sometimes what initially appears to us to be true, turns out to be based on a misunderstanding. They are not the reasons philosophers would reject it. >Even in the post you linked, the person cites sources that define atheism as the lack of belief in a god or gods to ""support"" their argument, Clearly that person is ignoring/dismissing the parts of the definition that they do not like. No they're not. They're supporting their point that lacking belief isn't widely accepted and isn't the definition philosophers use. They say - "" [IEP] explicitly notes the distinction between this so-called ""positive atheism"" and the broader ""negative atheism"" so as to clearly note that the sense which is widely accepted and which they will use is the narrower ""positive atheism"" >If someone says that the term ""atheist"" meaning ""one who does not believe in a god or gods"" is too confusing for them, The objection isn't that ""people"" are confused by the definition, it's that the definition ""confuses the issues"". >For instance, if they think that atheist is too confusing because it contains within it, two possible positions (one who believes that there are no gods and one who lacks a belief in a god or gods), This isn't the objection though. The two possible positions it confuses are atheism and agnosticism. Using the lack of belief definition means it's not possible to distinguish between them. It also necessitates eliminating agnostic as a distinct position. Because agnostics lack belief in God they're now called atheists. But this isn't an accurate description of their position because they also lack belief in no-God. Since agnostic is a substantial and important position on the question, this feature makes the definitions unacceptable. >So yeah, they ignore the bits that don't support their ignorant narrative, and then pretend that it's philosophy instead of just plain and simple dishonesty. You're being very uncharitable in your reading of that post and to the opposing view generally. It's quite insulting to call someone you disagree with dishonest and ignorant. They didn't ignore bit's that don't support their view. They were responding to particular myths and addressing them directly. They were rebutting claims made by some atheists that this lacking belief definition is the only correct definition. The title specifically says - ""First myth - ""That 'atheism' refers to the absence of a belief that God exists is just the correct definition of the word, as anyone who studies the issue would know..""",1

"The term could easily be applied to your twisted logic of applying standards for peer review publication to blogs. What exactly is ""shit weak""? A guy, whos done a degree in sports science and written two books, both of which are well referenced, writes a blog not a peer reviewed scientific article, about the psychological aspects and makes some allusions as to why they think that way and that there is some evidence to support this. You've never heard of him or come across his books, fair enough. But you pick at a blog post saying... > a lot of claims without any sources. > I require my articles back up their facts with data ...and... > If you make a claim you have to back it up with a source, if you argue that then I also think your credibility is in question. ..yet it isn't an article, its a blog post! You surely know the difference, its not hard to distinguish. One has gone through a rigorous process of review by qualified people and has to demonstrate that the claims made are based on sound methodology and can be substantiated, the other doesn't. You cant take or leave either, and its very clear that you are going to leave this particular blog post because it doesn't meet the standards required for peer review, but you are incorrect to try and apply the standards of one to the other. If someone who has a proven track record of a scientific approach to their sports training which has resulted in very real, tangible results and who has taken the time to write two well researched books about it says there is some evidence and that they will write more on it, then I'm happy to read what they have to say with a small degree of scepticism and wait for the more detailed in-depth article they have said they will post at a future date. I wouldn't completely dismiss it just because they haven't cited their source full strength away, because they have demonstrated to me in the past (I've read his books) that they take an objective approach to the study of their subject.

Almost always only if you have a buddy with you (who also gets estus and can be re-summoned as many times as you want) and you get +30% HP. Uh-huh. Exactly the same. So yeah, I do pity invaders.

If you're in it, then you know that you are going to be summoned into a fight you have a huge chance of winning because you will always outnumber your opponents. That's why whenever I summon a blue, I leave them to fight the invader on their own. Because I know how much it fucking sucks to get ganked by 2-3 guys at once and being unable to do anything about it because they're not idiots like the ones on this gif. > First, you cannot say with 100% certainty that they did it solely because he was a player and they just wanted to kill him (for ""kicks"", i believe you put it) with absolutely nothing else on their mind. That's just not possible. Second- of course they want to kill him. Like I said- he's solely there to kill them, and will do it any way possible. Getting rid of him sooner than later is just playing smart, not having wild bloodlust. No, I can't say it with 100% assurance that they get a kick out of ganking players. But if they're chasing after the invader like that then chances are that since everyone likes winning, and beating a player in PvP is winning, that they indeed do it because they want to win and not because stupidly chasing an invader down, ignoring literally everything else in the way because of how concentrated the hosts are in their future mashing of the R1 button, leaving a horde of enemies running after you and who knows how many items behind is optimal (there you go again saying that it's optimal while using different words then saying you didn't say anything of the sort, too). Like, dude... Look at the gif this very thread is about and tell me again, with a straight face, that chasing after the invader mindlessly was a good move. I'll spoil the answer for you: It wasn't a good idea to chase the invader like that because all 3 of the would-be gankers instantly died to the explosive barrels. > Clearly this isn't 100% the case, since it seems that plenty of people agreed with me already in that it wasn't a gank- along with a few other posts in this thread. Yeah. Those people also got their share of downvotes, hence the controversial symbol on their upvote count. Or they don't have that symbol and are just at negative or no upvotes. And because you got 40 people to upvote you doesn't really mean that they think this isn't a gank? For all you know they upvoted you to collectively congratulate the OP (which they should). Seeing how people who only said ""this isn't a gank"" were downvoted, and you, who said something I see worth upvoting for besides that were not, I'd say that a good part if not most of those people ""agreeing"" with you aren't doing it over the semantics. Even then, I'll repeat how this isn't suddenly not a would-be gank just because some people agreed with you on it. > Yes, they are. Like I said- I'm 100% on-board with invaders. I love them. However, by invading, you are 100% going into their world with the mission to kill them and steal an Ember/Shackle/Whatever, simply for your own benefit, and setting them back in any progress they may have made. Regardless of how you look at it. Yeah, uuuh, so? What's the point of this part? People don't invade for the rewards most of the time, either, but rather, because we enjoy chaotic, ruleless PvP. Doesn't mean that the game should be designed in an unfair way. Also, again, please stop acting like if every host and his phantoms are an innocent little nooblet. They very clearly enjoy beating you most of the time. That's why they taunt and celebrate. If they didn't care of the invader they'd do the smart thing and ignore them to get to the fog.",1

"edjumacate yourself my friend, the custom knife world is a huge and very diverse place :) no...you're absolutely right bro they are not customs either. Both Grimsmo and Hoback use a CNC to grind their blades. They use a CNC to cut all the milled out pockets, designs, and all the stop bar tracks etc. The only thing they do is finish the knife and ensure it is mechanically sound. Hoback did customs in the past, but not since he went full out with the CNC production of his stuff. they're about as 'custom' as a MSC ""performance series"", if that...at least Mick grinds the blades on those. then you have makers like peter carey and allen elishewitz, mayo, nalu, foster, ochs, barajas, rexford, southard, SIBERT...even emerson... that make the same model knife, but with multiple types of high finish materials, with complications...inlays, pivot rings, clips etc which are cut out, profiled, milled, pantographed and then hand fitted, not to mention dovetailing bolsters, shadowboxing frames, texturing..along with contouring and finishing. Makers like Burch utilize a CNC to help them cut out parts, but finish everything by hand, including grinding the blade, cutting locks and fitment. Each blade is cut from sheet, profiled, ground, heat treated and finished by one man, not a machine with a tool path. There is a INCREDIBLY LARGE difference between the two. you're comparing something like a BMW (albeit very high quality, not unique by any means) to something like a completely custom 458 italia ferrari...one is production produced, off the line and fitted to a certain set of tolerances. The other one is hand built to spec, and while there are many of the same model - the tweaks and individual complications is what makes it unique.",1

They come out of nowhere and have no relation to your current situation. This is due to the fact meditation is a purging process. It is delving into your subconscious and pulling emotions out of you. >A simple perusal of this sub shows most practitioners are, in fact, more acutely aware of their emotions. This is a temporary state. I consistently see people on this sub imagining that the results of a few hundred hours of meditation or less produces the same results as a few thousand hours. virtually people on this sub are novice meditators and they extrapolate from their current experiences what things will be like if they continue. It's like the person saying ""I drink coke occasionally and I'm perfectly healthy therefore if I drink 20 cokes a day for 10 years I'm going to be in exactly the same situation"". This makes no logical sense. >It isn't changing your feelings and emotions, it is changing your relationship to them.",1

but it's a little insulting to see all of the comments assuming that white women only latch on to their husband's wealth. You do realize that some women have made wealth on their own -- independent of their husbands -- right? My married woman voted for Trump. She swore me to secrecy about it. We've always been a split household. I'm liberal and very involved in the democratic party. She's not very involved in politics but was raised conservative and has always maintained she was fiscally conservative/socially liberal. She is a successful physician and owns her own practice with other doctors working underneath her. She makes way more money than I do and she controls all of our finances. She voted for Trump because she perceived him to be in her best interests financially. She hates paying taxes more than anything in the world. She also believes (rightly or wrongly) that the ACA has been detrimental to her business' bottom line (don't worry... she still makes plenty of money.) I get that we may be the exception to the norm...,1
"Do a little study on the actual mechanics of septic systems and soil science before you post again, eh? Dead wrong. I own part of a primitive campground in North Georgia that used jakes for a while: we had to move them every couple of years because they fill up with waste. Our lake registered higher e-coli and other fecal choliform levels each year until we got rid of the outhouses- and we weren't hosting thousands of people year-round, only a couple of events per year with a couple hundred campers there for no more than a week. We knew how to treat the pits, constructed the drainage to perk at optimum efficiency, all the right things. The result? They stank to high heaven, were full of wasps' nests and huge spiders, and more than once we had to run a raccoon or snake or skunk out of the latrine. Outhouses vanished from society when a better way of disposing of waste was developed. Why? Outhouses, latrines and shit-pits are vibrant breeding grounds for disease, they attract flies and other insects which spread disease, provide a hiding place for snakes, spiders and vermin. Add to that the general ignorance of people who believe that ""the old ways"" were better ways and we have a tidy little public health disaster just ripe for the taking.",1

We're talking about the likelihood of emergence. Not the number of times you can run a simulation. Are you suggesting that we would create a universe and then wait for eons for life to emerge? It does not have to be that way. There are many ways of simulating a universe. Imagine the SIMS game , just as they are today. Now imagine some guy manages to add some intelligence / sentience software to them . That's a simulated reality. No need for emergence. Do you agree with this? >Its called an objective point of view. But this is wrong. You are not being objective. You are missing the point. We are not talking about just any simulation we are talking about reality itself. And you miss it. >We're talking about emergence, not the number of times you can play a video game. Emergence of what? This is not about how many times you can play the SIMS game. Its about how many sims games you can create . If we can build one we have to assume that many more will be built. Lets take simple steps and see where its going wrong. 1) There can be only one base reality. 2)If we create a simulated universe then we can assume that many more will be built. 3)If there si only one reality and more than one simulated realities then our chances of being in a simulated one is higher . Do you agree with these claims. >Your argument is analogous to the strong anthropic principle. You're insinuating that intelligence and technology are some kind of end game as if the universe is in some sense compelled to eventually have technologically advanced life emerge within it. But only in a universe capable of eventually supporting life will there be living beings capable of simulating it. You are still at stuck at the same place. You are thinking we will create a universe just like ours , it will start with a big bang and we will wait for life to emrege etc etc . Forget it all. Just think about the sims example. Some guy , tomorrow creates an update to the SIMS game and it gives them the ability of consciuosness. From then on , in an instant , with no emergence , that guy will create a simulated universe. Do you agree with this? >You're ignoring all the selective pressures it takes to get to that point, and all of the worlds that likely exist that don't even develop life to being with. You are stuck with the idea that we have to follow the exact same path as nature does to create simulated realities. We don't.
